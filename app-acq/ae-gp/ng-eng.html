The <a href="/ecologisation-greening/achats-procurement/directive-guideline/index-eng.html">Guideline for Integration of Environmental Performance Considerations in Federal Government Procurement</a> and the <a href="/ecologisation-greening/achats-procurement/trousse-toolkit/index-eng.html">Environmental Awareness Toolkit</a> provide general information on Green Procurement principles and implementation, as well as links to additional resources that may prove helpful when completing the plan.</p>

  <p>The plan should be completed using resources within the Commodity Team. For general support within Acquisitions Branch, contact: <a href="mailto:Achatsecologiques.greenprocurement@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca">Achatsecologiques.greenprocurement@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca</a></p>
  <p>Following completion of the plan by the Commodity Team, expert advisors from EC, NRCan and OGGO, as well as OSME and Acquisitions Branch stakeholders, will review the plans from a technical and feasibility perspective and provide comments. The Commodity Team will then use the comments to finalize the strategy for applying Green Procurement to the Commodity and completing the Green Procurement Plan. The plan is to be started prior to initiating industry consultations, to ensure that suppliers are aware of Green Procurement requirements in advance of the RFx release.  Once consultations are completed, the plan can be finalized.</p>

  <h3 id="b1">Part II: Completing the Plan Part A: Questionnaire</h3>

  <p>See the link to the &quot;Questionnaire&quot; provided in Part 1 above. Follow instructions below to complete each section. Each section of the questionnaire can be completed by following the instructions below.</p>
  
  <h3 id="c1">Commodity</h3>
  <p>Identify the Commodity of goods or services for which the green procurement plan is being prepared and provide a description of the Commodity. This description will help green procurement expert advisors understand your commodity and therefore better support you.</p>
  

  <h3 id="d1">Solicitation/Contract Number</h3>
  <p>Provide the Solicitation/Contract number for the commodity for which the green plan is being prepared.</p>
  
  <h3 id="e1">Research</h3>
  <h4 id="e2">Section A: Key Environmental Impacts Associated with the Good or Service</h4>
  <p>Identify major environmental impacts associated with the good or service, based on the information provided. This can usually be identified by:</p>

  <ul>
   <li>Researching the product's environmental impacts on the internet;</li>
  <li>Reviewing environmental product certification criteria on sites such as the <a href="http://www.terrachoice-certified.com/en/">Environmental Choice</a> program; and,</li>
  <li>Discussing features with suppliers.</li>
 </ul>
  <p>See also the OGGO Web site's <a href="/ecologisation-greening/achats-procurement/trousse-toolkit/index-eng.html">Environmental Awareness Toolkit</a> and the <a href="/ecologisation-greening/achats-procurement/directive-guideline/index-eng.html">Guideline for Integration of Environmental Performance Considerations in Federal Government Procurement</a> for further resources.</p>

					Top of Page</a> </div>
  <h4 id="f1">Section B: Mitigation Actions</h4>
  <p>In collaboration with your commodity team, research and identify current green procurement actions being taken. These should include tips, lessons learned, best practices and recommendations related to demand management, asset management, operational/use practices, maintenance and disposal that could be implemented to improve environmental performance. The following questions should be considered:</p>
  <p>In this section, consider the environmental impact of the good/service being procured. Identify features of the most environmentally preferable alternatives. Ideally, this section should include a list of the criteria that would be used to specify the most environmentally preferable good/service on the market today.</p>
  <p>Highlight information that suppliers should be able to provide regarding the environmental attributes of their products, processes, and initiatives.</p>
  <p>Key resources to obtain this information are listed in the <a href="/ecologisation-greening/achats-procurement/trousse-toolkit/index-eng.html">Environmental Awareness Toolkit</a> and <a href="/ecologisation-greening/achats-procurement/directive-guideline/index-eng.html">Guideline for Integration of Environmental Performance Considerations in Federal Government Procurement</a> and include:</p>

  <ul>
   <li>Environmental certification programs, such as <a href="http://www.terrachoice-certified.com/en/">Environmental Choice</a>;</li>
  <li>Suppliers;</li>
  <li>Industry associations;</li>
  <li>NRCan and EC technical experts.</li>
 </ul>

  
  <h3 id="g1">Packaging</h3>
  <p>List actions taken related to packaging (Questions 1 through 4):</p>
  <ul>
   <li>requirements for suppliers to reduce packaging, recycle or take-back packaging</li>
  <li>restrictions placed on suppliers in terms of hazardous material contained in packaging</li>

  <li>responsibility for recycling/disposal</li>
 </ul>
  
  <h3 id="h1">Industry Capacity</h3>
  <p><em>Question 5:</em><br />
  Address suppliers' capacity to meet environmental criteria. Ideally, environmental criteria should be introduced as mandatory wherever feasible. In some cases, a number of suppliers will not have the technical capacity to meet the criteria or the cost premium associated with the criteria may be too high. In these cases, environmental specifications are often introduced as optional, point-rated criteria. As prices fall and/or suppliers gain capability, future RFXs can incorporate the criteria as mandatory. Key to this conversion to mandatory criteria is communication with the supplier base, to ensure that they make modifications to their processes or products to enable them to meet the criteria.</p>

  <p><em>Question 6:</em><br />
  Some departments have made decisions to select environmentally preferable suppliers, wherever possible. These departments need information on supplier attributes to be able to make appropriate choices. Some commodity groups post supplier descriptions to make it easier to identify appropriate suppliers. Some e-procurement tools also facilitate searches for items that meet environmental requirements.</p>

					Top of Page</a> </div>
  <h3 id="i1">Standards and Certifications that can be consulted when developing environmental criteria</h3>
  <p><em>Question 7:</em><br />
  List references to <em>environmental </em>good or service criteria relevant to the commodity. A number of organizations publish environmental criteria associated with specific goods or services. Suppliers who demonstrate compliance with the criteria are &quot;certified&quot; and allowed to display the organization's certification label. The specification of an environmental certification can facilitate the implementation of Green Procurement. Where this is not possible, the certification criteria, which are usually publicly available via the Web, can offer excellent insight into key environmental issues associated with goods and services as well as appropriate mitigation actions. Selected criteria can be incorporated into bid solicitations.</p>

  <p>Some key environmental certification programs or &quot;eco-labelling&quot; programs include Environmental Choice (Canada) and Green Seal (US). See the <a href="/ecologisation-greening/achats-procurement/trousse-toolkit/index-eng.html">Environmental Awareness Toolkit</a> on the <a href="/ecologisation-greening/index-eng.html">OGGO</a> Web site for further resources.</p>
  <p><em>Question 8:</em> <br />
  List commodity-specific standards. Many industry associations seek to develop guidance for their members in better managing their environmental performance. A good example is EPEAT (Electronics Product Environmental Assessment Tool), a set of 51 environmental criteria that apply to IT hardware. Other broader guides, such as EnergyStar, also address energy consumption of electronic and electric products.</p>

  <p><em>Question 9:</em> <br />
  Some commodities will be subject to specific policies or legislation that impact their environmental performance. For example, vehicle purchases within the federal government are affected by the Alternative Fuels Act. In addition, a quick search of industry initiatives will often provide an idea of the key environmental issues associated with purchases.</p>

					Top of Page</a> </div>
  <h3 id="j1">Implementation</h3>
  <h4 id="j2">Section C: Existing Green Procurement Initiatives - included in existing procurement instruments</h4>
  <p><em>Questions 1 to 4:</em><br />

  To answer the first four questions, identify current internal government initiatives related to the commodity:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are efforts being made to reduce consumption?</li>
  <li>Are surplus assets being better managed to ensure that they are used rather than acquiring new assets? Ex. Check on the availability of surplus furniture assets prior to buying new.</li>
  <li>Rationalization of assets: are studies being conducted to determine how asset use could be optimized? For example, could two older inefficient cars be replaced by one new hybrid car?</li>
  <li>What alternative goods or services are available that might have a lesser environmental impact? For example, furniture that has recycled content or a multi-function device that incorporates printing, faxing, scanning and photocopying rather than selecting several individual devices.</li>

  <li>Are initiatives being taken to reduce the impact of acquiring the goods, such as e-procurement?</li>
 </ul>
  <p><em>Questions 5:</em><br />
  Review existing standing offers, supply arrangements and contracts for mandatory and optional/point-rated environmental criteria. Review technical specifications that may incorporate elements such as Energy Star or ecolabels and Annexes that may be specific to environmental features. Criteria might include product specifications, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Low VOC emissions</li>
  <li>Recycled content of metal, plastic, fabric parts</li>

  <li>Use of low toxicity raw materials</li>
  <li>Eco-label certification</li>
  <li>EnergyStar</li>
 </ul>
  <p>And supplier specifications, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ISO 14000 certification</li>

  <li>Use of chain-of-custody methods</li>
  <li>Low emissions of GhGs</li>
 </ul>
  <p>Note requirements included within the RFX for suppliers to manage environmental aspects of the acquisition, use/maintenance and disposal phases of the procurement. These can be either mandatory or optional criteria. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Delivery by high-efficiency vehicles, to minimize GhG emissions</li>
  <li>Reports printed in double-sided format on recyclable paper from a certified source</li>

  <li>Recyclable consumables (ex. re-manufactured toner cartridges)</li>
  <li>Take-back programs for end-of-life goods to ensure proper recycling</li>
 </ul>
  <p><em>Questions 6:</em><br />
  Note when each of the above mandatory or optional criteria was initially incorporated into the bid specifications (this will facilitate the completion of the scorecard).</p>
  <div class="topPage"> <a href="#tphp" title="Return to Top of Page"><img src="/clf20/images/tphp.gif" alt="" width="19" height="12" /><br />
					Top of Page</a> </div>

  <h4 id="l1">Section D: Green Procurement Initiatives for the Upcoming RFX</h4>
  <p>In this section, note green procurement clauses and conditions that will be incorporated in the upcoming RFx'.  </p>
  <p>List also the specifications used in the Statement of Work (SOW) related to green procurement.  	</p>
  <p>List the environmental criteria used in the evaluation grid.  	</p>
  <p>Describe  the financial evaluation as it pertains to green procurement. The costs that will occur throughout the  entire lifecycle must be considered. Suppliers could potentially lower the prices for the environmentally  preferable options, when more weighting is given to these  options in the evaluation.</p>
  <p>Finally, demonstrate how  the green options within the procurement instrument are identified and  communicated to users (client departments). This is to make it easier for  clients to use the procurement instruments, and know in what way they are green  and how to pick the right procurement instruments and the right line items. </p>

  
  <h4 id="m1">Section E: Environmental Criteria and Specifications that have been identified in research but that will not be implemented in the upcoming RFx</h4>
  <p>Indicate the expected timelines for the implementation of the various initiatives and/or criteria.</p>
  <p>Issues exist when implementing Green Procurement. Key issues, and associated solutions, may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Competition issues: too few suppliers offer the environmental feature or exclusion of Canadian companies
    <ul>

     <li>Solution: Establish point-rated desirable criteria; communicate with suppliers to indicate that in future RFx', these criteria may become mandatory.</li>
   </ul>
   </li>
  <li>Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs): will the use of mandatory environmental criteria exclude SMEs?
   <ul>
     <li>Solution: Consult with SME office to incorporate provisions to avoid exclusion of SMEs.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>

  <li>Higher upfront costs for environmentally preferable goods
   <ul>
     <li>Solution: Demonstrate lower or equivalent cost over lifecycle. Address initial cost increment by allocating a portion of the budget to compensate for these costs, with expectation of cost recovery in later years. For high expenditures, consider alternative financing arrangements</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
  <li>Questions regarding performance of environmentally preferable goods and/or services
   <ul>
     <li>Solution: Require that suppliers demonstrate the performance of their goods/service</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 </ul>
  <div class="topPage"> <a href="#tphp" title="Return to Top of Page"><img src="/clf20/images/tphp.gif" alt="" width="19" height="12" /><br />
					Top of Page</a> </div>
  <h4 id="n1">Section F: Contacts</h4>
  <p>Indicate the names of the individuals who participated in the completion of the plan.</p>
  
  <h3 id="o1">Part III: Completing the Plan, Part B: Scorecard</h3>

  <p>The Scorecard is to be completed using information gathered during the completion of the questionnaire, particularly Sections C, D &amp;E , and in the course of conducting general supply analysis.</p>
  <p>A copy of a blank sample scorecard is provided in Part 1 at the beginning of this document.</p>
  <p>The purpose of the scorecard is to provide a visual snapshot of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Best In Class criteria for the particular commodity; in other words, what features characterize the most environmentally preferable good/service that can be procured within this commodity?;</li>
  <li>The status of implementation of green procurement, for the commodity, within the Government of Canada, as it relates to:
   <ul>

     <li>Existing procurement instruments in place (if applicable)</li>
   <li>Current RFXs being prepared</li>
   <li>New initiatives to be considered in future RFXs</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
  <li>Progress made to date on the implementation of Green Procurement and planned actions for future RFXs.</li>
 </ul>

  <p>The initiatives (Section A) and technical specifications/criteria (Section B) listed within the scorecard will vary from commodity to commodity and between services and goods. The elements to be included in the list should be identified through the normal supply analysis conducted by the Commodity Team when determining sourcing options.</p>

  <li>Better use of surplus assets</li>
  <li>Alternative goods identified that are environmentally preferable</li>
 </ul>
  <p>In addition, initiatives taken related to engaging suppliers should be identified. These might include the:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Completion of surveys to identify capacity amongst suppliers to provide environmentally preferable goods and services</li>

  <li>Regular communication of increasingly stringent environmental objectives to potential suppliers</li>
  <li>Bidders' environmental information made readily available to client departments</li>
 </ul>
