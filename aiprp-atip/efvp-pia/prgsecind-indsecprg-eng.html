	 <h2>Privacy Impact Assessment Summary</h2>
	 <h3><em>Purpose</em></h3>
	 <p> This Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is in relation to a proposal to substantially modify Personal Information Bank (PIB) <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> PPU 015.  Among the changes to the <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> is a thorough description of the consistent uses of personal information collected by the Industrial Security Program (ISP) of the Canadian Industrial Security Directorate (CISD).  In addition to sharing personal information with the RCMP, <acronym title="Canadian Security Intelligence Service">CSIS</acronym>, and credit bureaus in furtherance of determining a person's eligibility in the <acronym title="Industrial Security Program">ISP</acronym>, the consistent uses of personal information includes  sharing some personal information (i.e. screening and security clearance information) to a select group of authorized persons.  Those authorized persons include:  <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Procurement Officers, Project Authority Officials, and authorized Security Officials; authorized Security Officials are the following government officials: Departmental Security Officers and Unit Security Officers; and the following private sector officials:  Company Security Officers and Alternate Company Security Officers.</p>
	 <p>The  disclosure of &ldquo;screening and security clearance information&rdquo; will be done via  two methods: telephonically and through the future expansion of the Online Inquiry Service (OIS), a web-based application currently used by some of the  authorized persons in obtaining the needed &ldquo;screening and security clearance  information&rdquo;.  The expansion of <acronym title="Online Inquiry Service">OIS</acronym> will  include the inclusion of authorized persons who are currently not users of the  system.  Also, it will include the  release of additional information that is not currently available to existing  authorized users.</p>
	 <p>Moreover,  the revised <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> includes a reference to the sharing of personal information  with <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>&rsquo;s Controlled Goods Program (CGP), which is also referenced in their  <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym>, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> PIB PPU 045.</p>
	 <h3><em>Project Description</em></h3>
	 <p>The purpose of the <acronym title="Industrial Security Program">ISP</acronym> is to safeguard Protected and Classified information and assets entrusted to industry for contracts administered by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> and, on request, for contracts administered by other government departments (OGDs).  Part of that mandate is to assess a person's eligibility for a screening or security clearance level to work for the government, on a government contract, or to respond to a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
	 <p>A person typically applies for a screening or security clearance level through a Departmental Security Officer (a government authorized Security Official) or a Company Security Officer (a private sector authorized Security Official).  When applying, a person's signature authorizes the sharing of personal information to facilitate the investigation of the person's eligibility to hold a particular screening or security clearance level.  Once the screening or security clearance level is granted, the person's status/clearance level is &ldquo;held&rdquo; by the organization (governmental department or private sector company) that submitted the application.</p>
	 <p>In furtherance of it's goal to assist in facilitating the awarding of government contracts to authorized persons, it has historically been common practice for <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> to release details of a person's screening status or security clearance level regardless of which organization held the clearance.  The information was released to authorized Security Officials, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Procurement Officers, and Project Authority Officials only, and contained the least amount of information possible for these persons to staff government contracts and/or respond/award bids to an <acronym title="Request for Proposal">RFP</acronym>.</p>
	 <p>In October&nbsp;2008, <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> implemented a short-term solution that required consent forms from individuals, as well as attestation forms from authorized Security officials (stating they would not misuse the information).   While addressing this short-term solution <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> PIB&nbsp;PPU&nbsp;015 was identified as falling far short of what is required of a <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym>.</p>
	 <p>In addition to better explaining the personal information collected and its consistent uses, the scope of this project is to eliminate the need for consent forms, while also revising PIB&nbsp;PPU&nbsp;015 (referenced on all security forms) so that it succinctly and precisely spells out the personal information collected and how and why <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> uses it.</p>
	 <p>In  essence, this project desires &ldquo;screening and security clearance information&rdquo; to  be released to authorized Security Officials, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Procurement Officers, and  Project Authority Officials upon their request (after validation of their  identity).  The screening and security  clearance information desired to be released to these persons would be done  through <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym>&rsquo;s Call Centre, as well as the expansion of a web-based application  (Online Inquiry Service) to allow users the ability to verify the information  electronically.  <acronym title="Online Inquiry Service">OIS</acronym> would be expanded,  but would also include mandatory search criteria to eliminate random searching  by such indiscrete fields as &ldquo;first name&rdquo;. </p>
	 <h3><em>Parallel Effort</em></h3>
	 <p>This resulted in meetings between multiple agencies who have related <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym>s involving personnel security.  These meetings involved Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) (specifically <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym>), Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS), Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and Department of Defence (DND) in reference to the following <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym>s: </p>
	 <ol>
      <li><acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> PIB&nbsp;PPU&nbsp;015, Industry Personnel Clearance       and Reliability Records</li>
      <li>TBS PIB&nbsp;PSU&nbsp;917, Personnel Security Screening</li>
      <li><acronym title="Department of Defence">DND</acronym> PIB&nbsp;PPU&nbsp;834, Personnel Security Investigation       File</li>
	  <li><acronym title="Royal Canadian Mounted Police">RCMP</acronym> PIB&nbsp;PPU&nbsp;065, Security/Reliability Screening  Records </li>
	 </ol>
	 <p>A  collaborative effort is underway among these agencies to revise Treasury Board  security clearance forms (TBS/SCT&nbsp;330-23 and TBS/SCT&nbsp;330-60) while also  aligning each agency&rsquo;s <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym>s with similar language.  Therefore, the revised <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> may be amended to accommodate this  parallel effort with <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym>, <acronym title="Department of Defence">DND</acronym>, and <acronym title="Royal Canadian Mounted Police">RCMP</acronym>.   Moreover, changes to the Privacy Act Statement and consent declaration  of TBS/SCT&nbsp;330-23 and TBS/SCT&nbsp;330-60 in Annex D and E may also occur. </p>

	 <h2>Current Practices</h2>
	 <p>For private sector authorized Security officials the information is provided only if the person in whom they are inquiring about is an employee of their organization, or the person has provided an appropriate consent form.</p>
	 <p> The information is obtained by contacting the Call Centre, who validates the identity of the authorized individual, verifies consent is provided (if necessary), and emails the information in the following table to the authorized individual.  The Call Centre requires the authorized security official to provide the individual's name and date or birth; or name and personnel identification number. As most individuals do not know their personnel identification number, the use of an individual's date of birth is the only means available to properly identify an individual from the 350,000+ persons in the database.</p>
	 <p> For some authorized users, the information can also be obtained through the Online Inquiry Service (OIS).  For private industry persons, the security currently in place allows private sector authorized Security Officials access to their own employees only.  <acronym title="Online Inquiry Service">OIS</acronym> capabilities are expanded for <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> users, wherein they can view the name of the organization that holds the clearance. </p>
	 <h2>Proposed Future Explanation of Information/Data Values</h2>
	 <p><acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> proposes to provide to authorized Security Officials, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Procurement Officers, and Project Authority officials on all persons in the Industrial Security Program.</p>
	 <p> An authorized person could obtain this information from the Call Centre in the same manner that is used currently, or through <acronym title="Online Inquiry Service">OIS</acronym>.  <acronym title="Online Inquiry Service">OIS</acronym> would be expanded to include the data fields/elements below.</p>
	 <p> To avoid private companies from randomly searching on competitors, mandatory search criteria will be used.  A determination regarding the types of mandatory search criteria will be determined at a later date. </p>
	 <table class="basic fontSize90" summary="The table identifies the personal information proposed to be disclosed to authorized Security Officials, PWGSC Procurement Officers, and Project Authority officials on all persons in the Industrial Security Program.">

	 <p>As  with the current practice, it is imperative to note that the status of &ldquo;Denied&rdquo;  is not permitted to be released to anyone.   Although the status is used by <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> for those persons whose application  was denied, privacy issues preclude <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> from releasing that status.  For those person&rsquo;s whose status has been  denied, <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> releases the status of &ldquo;Close-Out&rdquo;. </p>
	 <p>As  indicated in the table, <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> wishes to continue using the same data elements  with the addition of releasing the name of the organization that holds the  individual&rsquo;s clearance.  By including  this additional data element, companies that are bidding on government <acronym title="Request for Proposal">RFP</acronym>s are  able to check the status of a person&rsquo;s screening or clearance, as well as the  name of the organization that holds the clearance.  This data is necessary in order for the many types of companies  to submit a bid to an <acronym title="Request for Proposal">RFP</acronym>, submit proposed personnel to an open contract  competition, and for the Government of Canada to ensure that properly cleared  individuals and companies are being chosen to perform work on contracts that  include security considerations.   Moreover, in some fields where government contracts include a prime  contractor and multiple layers of subcontractors, it is important  for the prime contractor to verify security  clearance information on sub-contractors.</p>

	 <h2>Elimination of the Consent Form</h2>
	 <p>Through this <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> and the parallel effort of amending Treasury Board forms and the <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym>S of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, <acronym title="Treasury Board">TB</acronym>, <acronym title="Royal Canadian Mounted Police">RCMP</acronym>, and <acronym title="Department of Defence">DND</acronym>, <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> desires to eliminate the need for the consent forms that have been in place since October&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2008.</p>
	 <h2>Identification of Privacy Risks</h2>
	 <p>During this Privacy Impact Assessment several privacy risks were identified.  In fact, privacy risks were the driving force behind the <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> management's decision to halt the current, yet long-standing practices, of the <acronym title="Industrial Security Program">ISP</acronym>.  In revising the <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> and completing the <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym>, the following risks were identified and addressed:</p>
	 <ol class="double-space">
      <li>The       current <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> Description includes an individual&rsquo;s Social Insurance       Number.  In the past, <acronym title="Industrial Security Program">ISP</acronym> has       required the SIN to obtain a credit report.  Since the authoring of the <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym>, a person&rsquo;s SIN is not       required to obtain a credit report.       Therefore, the revised <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> in Annex C no longer includes SIN as a       piece of personal information collected.    All record of SIN&rsquo;s collected in the past have been purged from       <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym>s database.</li>
      <li>The       current <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> was not all encompassing regarding the types of information       collected by <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym>.  The proposed       revised <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> provides a comprehensive categorical list of information that       may be collected by <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym>.  </li>
      <li>The       current <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> did not mention that sources other than <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> can be used to       collect personal information.  It       has long been acceptable for authorized Security Officials, with the       consent of the individual, and on behalf of the Government of Canada, to       collect personal information and provide it to <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym>. The revised <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym>       includes the collection procedures by sources other than <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>.</li>
      <li>The       current <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym>, under &ldquo;Classes of Individuals&rdquo; noted &ldquo;industry       personnel&rdquo;.  That distinction is       also not an exhaustive list of the classes of individuals with whom <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym>       collects information.  The revised       <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> provides a complete and comprehensive list. </li>
      <li>The       current <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym>, under &ldquo;Purpose&rdquo;, was not as explanatory as needed.  The revised <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> provides a more       thorough depiction, as well as notes that the <em>Financial Administration Act</em> and the Governmental Security       Policy provides the authority to <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> to collect and share the information       obtained.</li>
      <li>The       current <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> provided &ldquo;None&rdquo; under the description of Consistent Uses.  This was the most glaring problem with       the <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym>.  The revised <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> provides       succinct and thorough explanation of the consistent uses of the       information collected.  It iterates       that information collected supports decisions made by <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> regarding a       person&rsquo;s eligibility in the <acronym title="Industrial Security Program">ISP</acronym>.    It also reflects five areas of specific information sharing: <acronym title="Royal Canadian Mounted Police">RCMP</acronym>,       <acronym title="Canadian Security Intelligence Service">CSIS</acronym>, and credit bureau for requisite checks, as well as <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>&rsquo;s Controlled       Goods Program (CGP) and the sharing of some personal information with       authorized persons for the purpose of fulfilling personnel requirements as       defined in government contracts.   The proposed sharing of personal information will be provided in       accordance with Section 8(2)(a) of the <em>Privacy       Act</em>. This is the most vital of the revised <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> and the reason for the       <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym>.  It will allow <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> to       disclose a person&rsquo;s clearance or screening status, which will aid the       Government of Canada in awarding contracts.  It will also allow private sector officials with the ability       to verify personnel and organization security information in order to       respond to government <acronym title="Request for Proposal">RFP</acronym>s and real property needs.</li>
      <li>The       current <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> provided a retention and disposal explanation that was not       exhaustive.  In the revised <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym>,       the retention standard reflects two years following the last       administrative use.  As some       clearances are valid for 10 years, the retention schedule hinges on the       term &ldquo;administrative use&rdquo;, which includes termination of the employee from a contract or       employment, cancellation of the security clearance or screening, or       expiration of the security clearance or screening.  The disposal standards have also been       properly identified as being sent to Library and Archives Canada for       destruction, except for copies of forms kept by private industry, which       destroy their documents themselves.        Regarding the records held by private industry, destruction       guidelines must be done in accordance with the Industrial Security Manual,       section 511. </li>
      <li><acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> must address the 350,000+  individuals who signed the TBS/SCT 330-23 and/or TBS/SCT 330-60 form in its  current state.  Representatives from  PWGSC and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner are in discussions to identify  any necessary notification methods.   Preliminary discussions have identified one likely solution:   to notify the <acronym title="Company Security Officer">CSO</acronym>s, who will notify their  employees of the revisions to the <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym> forms and the <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym>.  As part of their role as security officials  in the <acronym title="Industrial Security Program">ISP</acronym>, <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> relies on <acronym title="Company Security Officer">CSO</acronym>s to perform a myriad of tasks.  Enlisting their services is not only an  extension of these duties, but is the most effective means available to ensure  that 350,000 individuals are given notice of the changes to the <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> and <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym>  forms.  Also, <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> will be posting communiqu&eacute;  in a prominent position on the website to assist in this notification  effort.  The communiqu&eacute; in Annex G is a  draft version of what will be posted on the website.  It may be amended or altered completely once Treasury Board  Secretariat revises their forms associated with personnel screening (TBS/SCT  330-23 and TBS/SCT 330-60). </li>
	 </ol>
	 <p>To  conclude, the privacy risks that exist with the current <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> and the  accompanying operating procedures of <acronym title="Canadian Industrial Security Directorate">CISD</acronym> are being addressed as a result of  this <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym>, and the revised <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym>, and proper communication to those affected will  be ensured.</p>
