				</ol>
				<h3 id="a1">1. Introduction</h3>
				<p>In support of the Government On-Line (GOL) initiative and, as  recommended in the Compensation Modernization Study, the Compensation  Sector of the Accounting, Banking and Compensation Branch (ABCB) of  Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) is progressively  implementing a series of secure, on-line, electonically delivered,  services known as Compensation Web Applications (CWA) for access by all  Government of Canada employees. The following reflect the current  services offered by the CWA: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Pension and Benefits Statement; </li>
					<li>Payment Stub on the Web; </li>
					<li>Request for Changes to Voluntary Deductions via Web; </li>
					<li>Gross-to-Net Regular Pay Estimate Calculator; </li>
					<li>Compensation Advisor Access to Web Applications for Employees; and </li>
					<li>Compensation Common Services Database/Classification Reform.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Additional functionality will be introduced within this framework in future upgrades to the service. </p>
				<p>The Access and Identity Management Services (AIMS) infrastructure  provides on-line registration and enrolment functionality in support of  these business level applications. This functionality is based on the  Incident Credential Management Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The  following reflects these major services:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Creation of an <strong><em>Anonymous Certificate</em></strong> for each registering employee; </li>
					<li>A <strong><em>Customization Service</em></strong> to the G-Pass <em>Self Administration Server</em> (SAS) that allows anonymous registration and integration through a G-Pass Secret Service; </li>
					<li>A G-Pass <strong><em>Secret Service</em></strong> to allow for recovery and revocation as a PKI self-administration function; </li>
					<li>A <strong><em>PIN Service</em></strong> to assist the Enrolment Service in the identification of enrolled users; and </li>
					<li>A <strong><em>Mapping Service</em></strong> to manage the PKI to application user identifiers.
						<p>For all systems, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat-published  Privacy Impact Assessment Policy requires that a formal assessment of  how the service offering ensure the privacy of any personal information  collected or made available throughout the service's life cycle. The  process encompasses the ten privacy principles reflected in that  policy. </p>
						<p>This summary of the formal Privacy Impact Assessment reflects  the finding and decisions emanating from that assessment. Its  presentation in this forum is intended to assure both public and  private sector Canadians that these services reflect the strong and  total commitment to privacy that the Government of Canada adheres to in  all its activities. <em>This PIA is restricted to the business  applications functions level only. A separate assessment of the  supporting infrastructure has been undertaken.</em> </p>
						<p>The formal review process of this PIA is now complete and the  Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) has confirmed that it is  satisfied that the Compensation Web Applications service poses a low  risk to the privacy of government employees. </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="a2">2. Business Benefits</h3>
				<p>The Compensation Web Application services developed and implemented  allow the Compensation Sector of the PWGSC ABCB to greatly reduce the  need to, and very high cost of, having to regularly print and  distribute employee pay and pension summaries. The on-line services  have also permitted the Branch to achieve a reduction in the number of  administrative staff that has traditionally been required to assist  Government of Canada employees in reviewing and initiating any changes  required to their personal accounts. </p>
				<p>As the service expands to incorporate additional capabilities, cost and manpower savings will continue to be realized. </p>

				<h3 id="a4">4. Privacy Risk Management</h3>
				<p>The Privacy Risk Management Plan summarizes specific privacy issues  and risks identified through the assessment process. Mitigating  measures taken to reduce or eliminate these risks have been identified  and implemented. There are no unresolved risks that might jeopardize  the privacy of individual employee users. </p>
				<p>There were only two outstanding privacy concerns identified in  the CWA PIA. The associated risks and mitigation strategies identified  are summarized in the following subparagraphs. </p>
				<h4>4.1 Privacy Act Principle 3 - Consent</h4>
				<p><em>Privacy Risk #1: </em> </p>
				<p class="indent1"><em>Data relating to employees who do not wish to enroll for the  on line service offerings must not be available to unauthorized users.</em></p>
				<p>Privacy Risk Mitigation Measure: An employee will be required to  submit a written request to be excluded. In such cases, the employee  data is then removed from the database and it becomes impossible for  anyone to enroll as that employee. IT should be noted that such an  &quot;opting out&quot; also results in the employee being deleted from all of the  CWA service offerings. Should the employee later change his/her mind a  formal request that his/her data to be reinserted into the database  must be submitted. The need for a more automated &quot;Opting Out&quot; process  will be reevaluated after the results of a one year evaluation period  using the manual process is concluded. </p>
				<h4>4.2 Privacy Act Principle 7 - Safeguarding of Personal Information</h4>
				<p><em>Privacy Risk #2: </em> </p>
				<p class="indent1"><em>That misuse may go undetected.</em></p>
				<p>Privacy Risk Mitigation: A &quot;Last Logged-in&quot; and all unsuccessful  attempts made from the time of an employee's last successful log-in is  uploaded to the employee at each log-in by the ICM Session Verification  Module and also be the PBS application. The employee is advised to  notify the service if the advisory is not correct. In addition, an  extensive Intrusion Detection System is being implemented within the  AIMS infrastructure to detect otherwise unnoticed attempts to misuse  the services. </p>
				<h3 id="a5">5. Communications Plan</h3>
				<p>A variety of communication&rsquo;s documents has been prepared to allow a progressively rolled out to employees. These documents include the key messages required, various messages or components, responsibility roles and  consultation process required prior to release. </p>
				<h3 id="a6">6. Conclusion</h3>
				<p>It is evident that the Compensation Web Applications business level  implementation has been designed with the view to improving and  maintaining privacy throughout the system lifecycle. The implementation  of anonymous certificates, session cookies, and other technical  mitigating measures, such as encryption of 'shared secrets', limiting  read/write access to the Central Services Database (CSDB), making use  of the proven ICM capability, conducting a Threat and Risk Assessment  (TRA), implementing processes such as annual audit and quality  assurance (QA), and system security certification and accreditation,  makes notable contributions to meeting privacy expectations and  requirements. </p>
