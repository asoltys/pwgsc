				<h1><a name="cont" id="cont">Certification Program for the Federal Government Procurement and Materiel Management Community Privacy Impact Assessment Summary</a></h1>
				<h2> Introduction</h2>
				<p>The publication of this summary of the Privacy Impact  Assessment (PIA) will help to assure employees of the Federal government that  the Government of Canada has undertaken significant measures to maintain the  privacy of their personal information provided for the purposes of the  Certification Program for the Federal Government Procurement and Materiel  Management Community. </p>
		        <p>The Privacy Impact Assessment Policy requires that the  PIA completed for the Certification Program for the Federal Government  Procurement and Materiel Management Community be provided to and reviewed by  the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC). With the formal review process  now complete, the results indicate that all privacy issues were addressed and the  OPC is satisfied that the Certification Program for the Federal Government  Procurement and Materiel Management Community poses few material privacy risks  to Canadians. The privacy risks identified are all considered low in severity,  relating mostly to process documentation.</p>
		        <h2>Background</h2>
		        <p>The Certification Program for the Federal Government  Procurement and Materiel Management Community is based on the Canadian General  Standards Board standard CGSB-192.1-2005: Competencies of the Federal  Government Procurement, Materiel Management and Real Property Community. It  enables practitioners in procurement and materiel management of the federal  government to obtain a professional designation recognizing their level of  qualifications. To obtain the professional designation, practitioners must meet  the training, experience and knowledge requirements of the program outlined in  the CGSB-192.1-2005 standard.&nbsp; </p>
		        <p>The personal information collected is used by the  Canadian General Standards Board to conduct an independent and impartial  assessment of candidate's qualifications against the requirements of the CGSB  standard CGSB-192.1-2005 Competencies of the Federal Government Procurement,  Materiel Management and Real Property Community. </p>
		        <p>The authority to collect personal information is  authorized by the DPWGS Act, section 7, 15, 16 and 17 and is found in  Order-In-Council Number: P.C. 1998-657.</p>
		        <h2>Nature of Personal Information Collected </h2>
		        <p>The different clusters of personal information  collected or used during the various Certification processes in support of candidature  in the Program for the Federal Government Procurement and Materiel Management  Community may include:</p>
		        <ul>
		          <li>Biographical Information</li>
		          <li>Contact Information</li>
		          <li>Educational Information</li>
		          <li>Employee Identification  Information</li>
		          <li>Administration, program,  activities identifiers</li>
		          <li>Other Assessments including  exam results</li>
        </ul>
		        <p>The personal information is collected for  Certification Program applicants who are employees of the Government of Canada  and its agencies. The information collected consists only of data provided by  the individual either directly or with consent at the time of collection with  no contextual sensitivities. </p>
		        <h2>Data Analysis and Data Flow</h2>
		        <p>Acting as the administrator for the program, the  Canadian General Standards Board maintains a database to collect and store  candidate information in conjunction with a hard-copy filing system. </p>
		        <p>Access to both systems is controlled to ensure that  only individuals who have a &quot;need to know&quot; can use and access the personal  information as per the Directive on Privacy Practices. Information is kept secure  and access is limited by physical means and by logistical means. The retention  and disposal procedures meet Government requirements, including the physical  safeguards of that data until disposal.</p>
		        <p>Information collected is necessary for the  administration of the certification program. All information stays within the  program. </p>
		        <p>The individual is providing the personal information  to PWGSC (CGSB) for the purpose of assessing their enrolment and their  qualifications against the requirements of the program. </p>
		        <p>Some of the information is provided to the Public  Service Commission (answers to a knowledge exam for marking) and then returned  to PWGSC (CGSB). The Public Service Commission does not keep any personal  information. </p>
		        <p>PWGSC (CGSB) shares information in the form of  statistical reports with interested stakeholders, notably the Treasury Board Secretariat  and the Canada School of Public Service. The statistical reports do not permit  parties to identify any individual. </p>
		        <p>Ultimately the program information is sent to Library  and Archives Canada for disposal.</p>
		        <h2>Privacy risks</h2>
		        <p>The privacy risks identified with the collection of  personal information in support of the Certification Program for the Federal  Government Procurement and Materiel Management Community have been evaluated  and determined to be low. </p>
		        <p>The privacy notice provided by ATIP has been added to  the handbook and to the forms used for the collection of personal information  as deemed necessary for the administration of the program.</p>
		        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
		        <p>This privacy impact assessment of the Certification  Program for the Federal Government Procurement and Materiel Management  Community did not identify any privacy risks that cannot be managed using the  current safeguards.</p>
		        <p>The collection of personal information for the  administration of the Certification Program for the Federal Government  Procurement and Materiel Management Community poses few privacy risks to  Canadians, all of which are considered to be low in severity.</p>
		        <p>These risks have been mitigated with the  implementation of the recommendations in the Privacy Risk Management Plan  including the implementation of a Privacy Notice to ensure each individual is  given the opportunity to provide meaningful consent at each stage of the  process. </p>
                <p>The Certification Program complies with the requisite  provisions of the Privacy Act, regulations and the Treasury Board Secretariat  Privacy Impact Assessment Policy.</p>
