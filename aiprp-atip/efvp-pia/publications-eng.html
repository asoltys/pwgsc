            <h2 id="a1">Introduction </h2>
            <p>Part of the mandate of the Public Works  and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) &ndash; Consulting, Information and Shared  Services Branch (CISSB) is to inform Canadians about the federal programs and services  available to them. To assist in this mandate, <acronym title="Consulting, Information and Shared Services Branch">CISSB</acronym> &ndash; Publishing  and Depository Services Program (PDS) has created a Web application to provide  an integrated computerized solution for the management, publishing, promotion  and sales of Government of Canada (GoC) publications. </p>
            <p>The Government of Canada Publications Web  site is designed to leverage the publishing, marketing and cataloguing  expertise of the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s Publishing and Depository Services Program to create  &quot;one-stop-shopping&quot; for <acronym title="Government of Canada">GoC</acronym> publications. </p>
            <p>This web site supports other Government of  Canada Primary Portals &ndash; the Canada Site, 1&nbsp;800 O-Canada, and the Service  Canada in-person centres - through providing e-access to bibliographical  information, publication availability, distribution sources and ordering  information.</p>
            <h2 id="a2">Benefits</h2>
            <p>Visitors benefit from end-to-end services  for searching, ordering, and purchasing Government of Canada publications.</p>
            <p>Credit card purchasing activities are  accomplished through the use of the Receiver General Buy Button (RGBB), a  secure shared government service.</p>
            <p><acronym title="Publishing and Depository Services Program">PDS</acronym> employs external service providers to  deliver its services such as shipping, warehousing and distribution services.</p>
            <p>Information about the Crown Copyright and  Licensing section and its activities is also made available on the Government  of Canada Publications Web site. Visitors  may request permission to reproduce, adapt,  revise and/or translate any Government of Canada works by downloading the  application form accessible from the web site in PDF format or by applying  on-line using the web form. The  web form provides a fast and easy way to fill out and submit requests for  copyright clearance on Government of Canada works.</p>

            <h2 id="a3">Report Objective</h2>
            <p>A privacy impact assessment (PIA) for this on-going initiative was conducted to determine if there were any privacy, confidentiality and security issues associated with the Government of Canada Publications Web site and its various components/interfaces, and if so, to make recommendations for their resolution or mitigation.</p>
            <h2 id="a4">Description</h2>
            <p>For information on Government of Canada Publications, customers can send their questions or their comments through the <acronym title="Government of Canada">GoC</acronym> Publications Web site using the Contact Us form or call directly the <acronym title="Publishing and Depository Services Program">PDS</acronym> Customer Service.  Personal information collected includes name, telephone number and e-mail address if the visitor wants to receive an answer.</p>
            <p>Customers can purchase Government of Canada Publications through the <acronym title="Government of Canada">GoC</acronym> Publications Web site in addition to traditional channels (i.e. mail, fax, and phone).</p>
            <p>Only personal information needed for order fulfillment is requested from individuals.</p>
            <p>Personal information collected by the web order form is the same information that <acronym title="Publishing and Depository Services Program">PDS</acronym> has been collecting via paper form, and is typical of personal information collected for order fulfillment.  The personal information includes individual's name, and either the individual's home or office contact details such as mailing address, e-mail address, fax number and telephone number.</p>
            <p>Ordering from the Government of Canada Publications Web site is a matter of choice by the customer and, therefore, consent is inherent with that choice.</p>
            <p>Customers who select to pay by credit card through the <acronym title="Government of Canada">GoC</acronym> Publications Web site are directed to the Receiver General Buy Button (RGBB) Web interface. This secure Web interface collects and validates the customer's credit card information.  If the credit card payment is accepted, the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> Web interface returns the authorization number for the payment.</p>
            <p>The authorized credit card order is then submitted via an automated interface to the Inventory / Order / Sales management application for order fulfillment. The authorization number is stored in the Inventory / Order / Sales management application and used to process the payment.</p>
            <p>The <acronym title="Government of Canada">GoC</acronym> Publications Web application does not process, capture or store any credit card information.</p>
            <p>Existing customers who have pre-established credit with <acronym title="Publishing and Depository Services Program">PDS</acronym> can charge their order on account through the <acronym title="Government of Canada">GoC</acronym> Publications Web site.  Such orders are automatically submitted to the Inventory / Order / Sales management application for order fulfilment.  The customer's shipping data is then sent to the external warehouse.</p>
            <p>At any time prior to confirm their online order/payment, customers have the option of canceling the transaction and can choose another channel such as mail, fax or telephone to submit their order.</p>
            <p>Customers who select to pay by cheque or money order through the <acronym title="Government of Canada">GoC</acronym> Publications Web site are informed to print the completed order form and mail it along with their payment to Publishing and Depository Services Program.</p>
            <p>Customers who prefer to use the paper-based order form can mail or fax their order to <acronym title="Publishing and Depository Services Program">PDS</acronym> Customer Service.  Customers may also contact the Customer Service Desk directly to request publications of their choice. Faxes are received in a restricted access room.</p>
            <p><acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> also provides a Web console service where telephone, mail or FAX orders with credit card payments are authorized and captured. The authorization number returned from <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> is recorded with the order. All correspondence received is secured in a locked cabinet with restricted access. </p>
            <p><acronym title="Publishing and Depository Services Program">PDS</acronym> discloses personal information in accordance with section 8(2)(a) of the <em>Privacy Act</em>, for the completion of inquiries and orders pertaining to <acronym title="Government of Canada">GoC</acronym> Publications.</p>
            <p>Financial transactions such as sales and account receivables are submitted to the departmental finance system. Customer information such as name, address, telephone number and E-Mail is also provided and stored in the departmental financial system for the purpose of adjustments and reconciliation, should the customer need to be contacted.</p>
            <p>Visitors are being informed of the purpose for which their personal information is being collected at every point of collection throughout the Publications website.</p>
            <p>Occasionally, <acronym title="Publishing and Depository Services Program">PDS</acronym> promotes Government of Canada publications to subscribers to its mailing list.  New customers as well as current ones are being informed of the Government of Canada Publication's mailing list for promotional material and have the opportunity to sign up to receive promotional material while they place an order.</p>

            <h2 id="a7">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This privacy impact assessment of the <acronym title="Government of Canada">GoC</acronym> Publications Web application did not identify any privacy risks that cannot be  managed using either current safeguards or others that have been specifically  developed for the implementation of the system.</p>
            <p>The <acronym title="Government of Canada">GoC</acronym> Publications Web application  poses few privacy risks to Canadians, all of which are considered to be low in  severity as they relate mostly to process documentation.</p>
            <p>These risks have been mitigated with the  implementation of the recommendations in the Privacy Risk Management Plan.</p>
