        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The publication of this  summary of the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) will help to assure employees of  the Federal government that the Government of Canada has undertaken significant  measures to maintain the privacy of their personal information provided while  using the Translation Bureau Integrated Information System (IIS) of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>.</p>
        <p>The Privacy  Impact Assessment Policy requires that the <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> completed for the <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym>  application be provided to and reviewed by the Office of the Privacy  Commissioner (OPC). With the formal  review process now complete, the response from the <acronym title="Office of the Privacy  Commissioner">OPC</acronym> has confirmed that, with  the commitments given to address specific privacy concerns raised in the <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym>,  the <acronym title="Office of the Privacy  Commissioner">OPC</acronym> is satisfied that the <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> poses few material privacy risks to  Canadians. The Privacy Risk Management  Plan addresses all privacy concerns raised in the <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> and additional  communications with the <acronym title="Office of the Privacy  Commissioner">OPC</acronym> in a satisfactory and appropriate manner.</p>
        <p>The Privacy  Impact Assessment for the <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> identifies 5 privacy concerns that can be  mitigated by implementing the recommendations in the Privacy Risk Management  Plan. The privacy risks identified are  all considered low in severity, relating mostly to process documentation.</p>

		<h2>2. Business Model</h2>
        <p>The Integrated Information  System is a mission-critical, web-based order-entry application used by all  sectors of the Translation Bureau and its Federal government Clients, including  the House of Commons and Senate. <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> facilitates  the submission and delivery of translation and linguistic services. The application is used to streamline and  optimize the Bureau&rsquo;s business processes such as workflow management, tracking  incentives for translators, and improving services to its client communities  (i.e. Order management). <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> is also the  data source that feeds the Translation Bureau Billing System.</p>
        <p><acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> is hosted on  a series of servers located behind a firewall at <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>&rsquo;s Aviation Parkway Data  Centre. Clients connected to the  Translation Bureau network are connected through the Government&rsquo;s SCNET network  to the secure infrastructure. The <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym>  application is only available on SCNET.</p>
        <p>The Oracle 9i database server authentication  and authorization have been applied so that only the Database Administrator and  the <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> application servers have access to the data. No other direct access to the database is  viable. The <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> application is accessible only through an encrypted  communication port (Secure Socket Layer version 3 - SSLv3) and only  authenticated users have access to the application.</p>
        <h3>Client Registration</h3>
        <p>Clients of  Government departments wishing to use <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> for the purpose of submitting  translation or linguistic Orders, must first be registered in <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym>. During the registration process, users are  asked to enter information such as their name, language for correspondence,  telephone number, address, mailing address (if different), and email  address. Once successfully registered,  users (i.e. known as <em>Contacts</em>) are permitted to use <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> and submit  Orders. In addition, Contacts are able  to access their registration  information at any time and make changes to it.</p>
        <p>The  information collected from Clients is not viewed as personal information under  the meaning of section 3 of the Privacy Act. </p>
        <h3>Translation Bureau Employee Registration</h3>
        <p>For all Bureau employees, it is the  responsibility of the employee&rsquo;s supervisor (i.e. manager) to create the  employee&rsquo;s profile in <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> and must:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter the  employee&rsquo;s  information such as name,  language for correspondence, telephone number, address, and email address;</li>
          <li>Enter the  employee&rsquo;s <acronym title="Personal Record  Identifier">PRI</acronym> and Classification information;</li>
          <li>Identify the user  as an <em>internal resource</em> in <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notes</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bureau employees  can access their own personal information directly via <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> and make changes to  anything other than their <acronym title="Personal Record  Identifier">PRI</acronym>;</li>
          <li>The <acronym title="Personal Record  Identifier">PRI</acronym> can only  be viewed or modified by the employee&rsquo;s manager; and</li>
          <li>Only users  identified as an <em>internal resource</em> will have a <acronym title="Personal Record  Identifier">PRI</acronym> in <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The only  personal information collected by <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> pertains to Translation Bureau employees  (i.e. users identified as <em>internal resources</em>). The information is: name, Personal Record  Identifier (PRI), the time spent on specific tasks and projects, and the  language preference of employees.</p>
        <p>The employee  name, <acronym title="Personal Record  Identifier">PRI</acronym> and working hours are passed on to the <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> Incentive and Billing  modules in order to: manage resources, determine employee monetary incentives  (if applicable), and to bill Clients. The language for correspondence is used by the application to correspond  with the user in the language of his/her choice.</p>
        <h3>Orders</h3>
        <p>Once an Order  (i.e. document to be translated) has been received and estimated, the work is  assigned to an available internal resource, and the internal resource carries  out the work.</p>
        <h3>Timesheets</h3>
        <p>All persons  identified as internal resources, must complete a timesheet for each project  completed (i.e. Order) and/or task performed.</p>
        <h3>Billing Process</h3>
        <p>After all tasks associated with an Order are completed, verified and  approved, the Order is closed and flagged ready for billing. The billing information is extracted monthly  to the Translation Bureau Billing System.</p>
        <h3>Privacy Notice Statement</h3>
        <p>As per the  Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat Common Look and Feel (CLF) guidelines, a  link to <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>&rsquo;s Government of Canada Privacy Notice is accessible to all users  of the <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> application. This notice  summarizes the privacy policy and practices of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>&rsquo;s web sites.</p>
        <p>In addition, <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym>  provides a Privacy Notice Statement outlining the specific purposes for the  collection of personal information and the authority for doing so. This notice is presented to all <em>internal  resources</em> upon their first successful login only. </p>
        <p>The <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> Privacy  Notice Statement describes the purpose of collection, use, and disclosure of  all personal information obtained by the site, and the Personal Information  Bank (PIB) where the information is securely stored. The <acronym title="Integrated Information System">IIS</acronym> Privacy Notice summarizes the privacy  policy and practices adhered to on the site.</p>
        <p>Once <em>internal  resource</em> users have read the notice, they are asked to proceed to the  application. Consent to collect personal  information is not required from the employee, as the information is required  to enable the management of resources, the billing of clients, and the payment  of incentives to employees in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding  between the <em>Treasury Board of Canada</em> and the <em>Canadian Union of  Professional and Technical Employees</em> respecting the Financial Incentives  Plan for the Translation Bureau.</p>
