				<h1><a name="cont" id="cont">Receiver General Buy Button (RGBB) Upgrade Privacy Impact Assessment Summary</a></h1>
				<h2>Introduction and background</h2>
				<p>The  <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> service modernization will continue to enable <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> clients to use the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym>  for credit card and now also <em>Interac</em> as  payment processing methods. The payment information is processed electronically  using the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> service from <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> clients' web sites (also known as storefronts)  that accept electronic payments. </p>
				<p><acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> clients will continue  to use the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> service as a means to process payments from individuals of the  general public. The <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> provides the  necessary tools to allow <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> clients to manage online, mail orders and /or  in-person payment for goods or services, through the provision of  authentication, and administration processes. The use of these processes  facilitates secure and private exchange of customer payment data with payment  processing service providers on behalf of <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> clients. </p>
				<p>The user community  for the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> Service consists of:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym>  clients including any government department/agency or other levels of  government who want to use the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> service to accept payments from their web  storefront for goods or services procured by customers; and,</li>
					<li>Customers  wanting to make payments to <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> client for goods or services</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="topPage"> <a href="#tphp" title="Return to Top of Page"><img src="/clf20/images/tphp.gif" alt="" height="12" width="19" /><br />

				<h2>Personal information collected by existing <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym>  Service</h2>
				<p>The different clusters of personal information  collected or used during the various <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> business processes are as follows: </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong><acronym title="Credit Card Number">CCN</acronym>:</strong> Identifies the Credit Card Number required to process the customer's request to  pay for the goods or services using their credit card. </li>
					<li><strong>Expiry Date:</strong> Identifies the credit card expiration date to  confirm if the credit card is active or expired.</li>
					<li><strong>Address:</strong> Identified the address of the cardholder for billing or address verification  purposes. </li>
					<li><strong>Reason Codes: </strong>Reason codes collected by the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> are personal  information since they are linked to the <acronym title="Credit Card Number">CCN</acronym> or cardholder name. The reason  codes are contained in the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> relational database repository, and are  accessed by the application components to verify the validity of payment  processing details presented by the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> clients' customers, but does not  contain any information that identifies an individual. The reason codes are  displayed in plain text. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The  application also collects and retains transaction data from the selling  department that is required for processing the transaction. This information includes the selling  department's ID, transaction type, departmental reference number, transaction  amount and the language last used by the customer on the department's website  (so that the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> web pages can be presented in the same language for  consistency). Transaction data  collected from the department is assigned a <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> transaction ID and the data  collected from the customer is appended to that record.</p>
				<div class="topPage"> <a href="#tphp" title="Return to Top of Page"><img src="/clf20/images/tphp.gif" alt="" height="12" width="19" /><br />

				<h2>New Personal information collected by upgrade  <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> Service</h2>
				<p>The new personal information collected or used during  the various upgraded <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> business processes is as follows:&nbsp; </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Name:</strong> Identifies the name of the credit card holder buying the service/product from  the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> client storefront.</li>
					<li><strong>Address:</strong> Email or physical address of the cardholder as required for transaction receipt  purposes. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>Other information elements pertaining to the  customers' online transactions are also collected or used, such as customer  session logs, content of temporary cookies and signature verification logs. The  architecture design specifications, however, do not permit these information  elements to identify individuals or to be linked to individuals.</p>
				<p>The customer is provided with the opportunity to  review the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> privacy statement on the payment page where they are required  to submit personal information. The privacy statement describes the reason for  collection, the specific use, the retention period, disposal procedures and  Personal Information Bank (PIB) where the personal information is stored.</p>
				<p>The  <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> administrative web interface is used to perform the following: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Initiate  credit card sales or authorization (possibly <em>Interac </em>sales in the future<em>)</em>;</li>
					<li>Perform  refund or void of transactions previously completed by a merchant;</li>
					<li>Automate  end-of-day processing of funds  settlement and deposit;</li>
					<li>Securely  store transaction data; and</li>
					<li>Support  execution of Adhoc queries and reports as well as profile maintenance related  activities.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Privacy  risks</h2>
				<p>Privacy risks and potential risk mitigation measures  have been identified in the PIA report. These risks are summarized below.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Ensuring that personal information is maintained in a  secure and robust infrastructure and physical location.</li>
					<li>Ensuring that privacy and security obligations on data  are addressed in third-party agreements (Terms of Engagement and Set-up Forms)  between the PWGSC, OGDs, and the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> Service vendor via interface information  exchange or supporting the related services.</li>
					<li>Publishing a harmonized retention and disposal  procedures that meet Government requirements, PIPEDA and PCI DSS including the  physical safeguards of that data until disposal.</li>
					<li>Documenting the changes and updating the PIB to  reflect the updated <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> service data collection requirements.</li>
					<li>Developing a harmonized privacy notice that reflects  the <em>Privacy Act</em> and PIPEDA requirements adequately.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>A number  of privacy risks have been identified with the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> upgrade service and are  evaluated at 'low' in severity with a plan to mitigate these risks within an  acceptable timeframe. </p>
				It is important to note  that the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> basic business model has not changed only the service provider  and the collection of two additional pieces of personal information which will  ensure accurate and secure payments are processed. The introduction of a payment  gateway with multiple options within the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> may raise privacy concerns. In that context, customers should be  reminded that privacy protection was and remains a pivotal factor for the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym>'s  choice of subcontracting to a PCI DSS Level 1 certified processing vendor. Customers who wish to further protect their  privacy can also elect to procure <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> client services using different payment  options such as credit card and <em>Interac</em>,  thereby rendering the Credit Card Number a payment processing specific identifier,  and not a common identifier. <!-- InstanceEndEditable --> </div>
