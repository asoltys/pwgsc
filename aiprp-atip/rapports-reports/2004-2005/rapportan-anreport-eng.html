				<h3 id="a">Preface</h3>
				<p> The <em>Access to Information Act</em> and the <em>Privacy Act</em> (Revised Statutes of Canada, Chapter&nbsp;A-1, 1985) were proclaimed on July&nbsp;1, 1983. </p>
				<p> The <em>Access to Information Act</em> gives Canadian citizens and individuals present in Canada a broad right of access to information contained in government records subject to certain specific and limited exceptions. </p>
				<p> The <em>Privacy Act</em> extends to individuals the right of access to information about themselves held by the government, again subject to specific and limited exceptions. The law also protects the individual's privacy by preventing others from having access to personal information and gives individuals substantial control over its collection and use. </p>
				<p> Section 72 of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> and Section&nbsp;72 of the <em>Privacy Act</em> require that the head of every government institution shall prepare for submission to Parliament an annual report on the administration of the Acts within the institution during each fiscal year. </p>
				<p> These Annual Reports provide a summary of the management and administration of the Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) Acts within Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) for the fiscal year 2004-2005. </p>

				<h3 id="aa"> PART I: Background </h3>
				<h4 id="aaa"> 1. Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) </h4>
				<p> Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) was created in 1993 through the amalgamation of former Public Works Canada (PWC), Supply and Services Canada (SSC), Government Telecommunications Agency, and the Translation Bureau (Secretary of State of Canada). </p>
				<p> PWGSC is the major provider of central and common services to the Government of Canada. In November 2003, PWGSC initiated a departmental realignment in conjunction with Treasury Board's Expenditure and Management Review. The new structure implemented provides an integrated client service model to help deliver timely and value added services for the government and Canadians as a whole. </p>
				<p> In December, 2003, the Government On-Line (GOL) and Shared Services Integration responsibilities from Treasury Board Secretariat - Chief Information Office Branch were transferred into the Information Technology Services Branch (ITSB) and the Service Integration Branch (SIB) respectively. </p>
				<p> On April&nbsp;1, 2004, the functions of Communication Canada were transferred to PWGSC and formed the Government Information Services Branch (GISB). GISB manages the Government's communication platform by providing information on Government programs and services. </p>
				<p> The delivery of common services continues to allow for a principal point of entry for departments to access real property, procurement and IT services, as well as allowing for the management of the day-to-day operational relationship with PWGSC's clients. The Service Integration Branch also acts as the point of contact for the five regional offices (Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, Western, and Pacific). </p>
				<p> Developing real property policy, managing the government procurement program, and supporting the common technical infrastructure are executed through three&nbsp;(3) program branches: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Real Property Program Branch </li>
					<li> Acquisitions Program Branch </li>
					<li> Information Technology Services Branch </li>
				</ul>
				<p> Banking and Cash Management, Central Accounting and Compensation, the Cheque Redemption function and Superannuation Services continue to be delivered through the Accounting, Banking and Compensation Branch. </p>
				<p> Internal services which support PWGSC's corporate level are carried out by the Corporate Services, Human Resources, and Communications Branch. </p>
				<p> The two Special Operating Agencies remain: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Consulting and Audit Canada </li>
					<li> Translation Bureau </li>
				</ul>

				<h3 id="b"> Part II: Report on the <em>Access to Information Act</em> </h3>
				<h4 id="ba"> 1. Organization of the Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) Directorate </h4>
				<p> The ATIP Directorate administers the provisions of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> for PWGSC, including two Special Operating Agencies namely the Translation Bureau and Consulting and Audit Canada. </p>
				<p> For most of the 2004-2005 fiscal year, the ATIP Directorate has operated under the leadership of six separate teams in order to better manage the types of requests received within the Department. One team solely processes requests associated with sponsorship, advertising and public opinion research issues, while two other teams process all other ATI requests, complaints, and court cases received by the Department. One team is committed to dealing with privacy, policy and Government-On-Line issues, while another is responsible for training and special projects. Finally, one team is involved with the administrative functions conducted by the ATIP Directorate. </p>
				<h5 id="baa"> 1.1 Delegation Instruments </h5>
				<p> Under Section 3 of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>, the Minister of the Department is designated as the head of the government institution for the purposes of the administration of the <em>Act.</em> </p>
				<p> The delegation instrument continued to be based on a centralized process with the Director, ATIP, responsible for full delegation of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>. In February, 2005, certain administrative functions were delegated to the ATIP Chiefs. This delegation has been limited to the following provisions: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Paragraph 7(a) Respond to request for access (nil reply only) </li>
					<li> Subsection 8(1) Transfer to and from other government institutions </li>
					<li> Section 9 Extension of time limits </li>
					<li> Subsections 11(2) to 11(6) Additional fees and fee waiver </li>
					<li> Section 27 Notification to third parties </li>
				</ul>
				<h5 id="bab"> 1.2 Responsibilities of the ATIP Office </h5>
				<p> The Director, ATIP, reports to the Director General of Executive Secretariat, who, in turn, reports to the Assistant Deputy Minister of the Corporate Services, Human Resources, and Communications Branch. </p>
				<p> The responsibilities of the ATIP Directorate include the following: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> managing all activities within PWGSC relating to the operation of the <em>Act</em>, as well as the regulations, directives and guidelines pursuant to them; </li>
					<li> developing, producing and promulgating departmental ATI policies, procedures, standards and guidelines; </li>
					<li> developing and delivering awareness training to PWGSC managers and employees to ensure departmental responsiveness to the legal obligations imposed on them by the <em>Act</em> and Regulations; </li>
					<li> reviewing departmental policies, procedures and agreements to ensure that they are in compliance with the provisions of the <em>Act</em> and making recommendations for amendments; </li>
					<li> defending institutional decisions on the administration of the <em>Act</em> during investigations conducted by the Information Commissioner and during judicial proceedings at the Federal Court of Canada and the Supreme Court of Canada; </li>
					<li> coordinating and approving the annual update of the PWGSC's descriptions of its organization and its record holdings for inclusion in the Treasury Board publication <em>Info Source</em>; </li>
					<li> reporting annually to Parliament in accordance with section 72 of the <em>Act</em> and any instructions issued pursuant to paragraph 70(1)(d) of the <em>Act</em>; </li>
					<li> acting as spokesperson for the Department in dealings with the Treasury Board Secretariat, the Information Commissioner of Canada and other government departments and agencies. </li>
				</ul>
				<p> The administration of the legislation by the ATIP Directorate is also facilitated at the branch, sector, and regional office levels. Each organizational sector has an ATIP Liaison Officer (normally reporting to an Assistant Deputy Minister, a Director General, or a Regional Director General) who coordinates activities and provides guidance on the operation of the <em>Act</em>, departmental directives and procedures. </p>

				<h5 id="bac"> 1.3 Summary of Activities and Highlights </h5>
				<h6> 1.3.1 Departmental Policy on ATIP </h6>
				<p> Departmental Policy 002 sets out the ATI delegation of authority order, definitions, and the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders within PWGSC. The policy was revised during this fiscal year and is pending management board approval. </p>
				<h6> 1.3.2 ATIP Liaison Officers' Handbook </h6>
				<p> The ATIP Liaison Officers' Handbook is produced by the ATIP Directorate and used as a guide to: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> introduce the ATIP Liaison Officers across the Department to the <em>Access to Information Act</em> legislation and regulations; </li>
					<li> outline the roles and responsibilities of each PWGSC ATIP stakeholder; </li>
					<li> provide national processing standards; and present guidelines for the local handling of requests. </li>
				</ul>
				<h6> 1.3.3 ATIP Directorate Desk Procedures </h6>
				<p> To standardize the work procedures used by office staff, facilitate the training of new staff and complement the processes of the electronic ATIP tracking system (ATIPflow), the ATIP Directorate developed and regularly updates its ATIP Officer desk procedures manual. </p>
				<h6> 1.3.4 Information Sessions </h6>
				<p> Given the complex character of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> and the need to balance the public's right to access information with the need to protect the legitimate interests of other parties, the ATIP Directorate provided guidance as well as information sessions, on an &quot;as required&quot; basis, to the Department including: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> 137 individuals from the Acquisitions Branch; </li>
					<li> 80 individuals from the Ontario Region; </li>
					<li> 60 individuals for the Material Management Institute - Procurement Community Conference; </li>
					<li> 31 individuals from the Communication Procurement Directorate; </li>
					<li> 21 individuals from the Service Integration Branch, Client Service Team; </li>
					<li> 20 individuals from the Parliamentary Precinct Directorate; </li>
					<li> 16 Departmental Ethics Officers; </li>
					<li> 8 individuals from the Information Technology Services Branch. </li>
				</ul>
				<p> The ATIP Directorate has also contributed as presenters to the Management Orientation Course (MOC) and the Employee Orientation Course (EOC). In all, 7&nbsp;presentations were made to 190&nbsp;departmental managers informing them of their roles and responsibilities under the Access to Information and Privacy legislation and policies. </p>
				<h6> 1.3.5 Briefings </h6>
				<p> New senior management and ministerial exempt staff were briefed on their roles and responsibilities under the <em>Act</em>. Additional briefings were conducted on an as required basis. </p>
				<p> Throughout the fiscal year, briefings were also given to all new ATIP Liaison Officers at the commencement of their duties. As new ATIP Liaison Officers were added to the departmental ATIP network, an additional 11 briefings were given to new ATIP Liaison Officers. </p>
				<h6> 1.3.6 Informal Access </h6>
				<p> The posting of senior management travel and hospitality expense summaries as well as contracting information on the Internet has provided the public with access to information relative to commonly requested information. The Internet address for travel and hospitality expenses is <a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/proactive/voyage-travel/index-eng.html">http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/proactive/voyage-travel/index-eng.html</a> and for contractual information, <a href="http://www.contractscanada.gc.ca/en/index.html">http://www.contractscanada.gc.ca/en/index.html</a> </p>
				<h6> 1.3.7 Credit/Debit Card </h6>
				<p> The ATIP Credit/Debit Card System, upgraded during the 2000-2001 fiscal year, continues to offer an increase in value-added service to the Public to facilitate the payment of fees by credit cards or debit cards. The system accepts payment by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Diners/Enroute and Interac. </p>
				<h6> 1.3.8 Request for Proposal - Imaging Software Solution </h6>
				<p> In order to respond to the growing number of requests and the increasingly large volume of records to sever, the ATIP Directorate initiated a request for proposal for the provision of an imaging software solution. </p>
				<h6> 1.3.9 Special Studies </h6>
				<p> Since the Information Commissioner's 2002-2003 report card, PWGSC has continued to review procedures and processes to improve the timely delivery of information to the public, both on a formal and informal basis. The ATIP Directorate developed a multi-year ATI Improvement Plan based on the recommendations made by the Information Commissioner of Canada. </p>
				<p> This Improvement Plan continued to set the course for the past fiscal year's activities. The activities completed were: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> Awarded a multi-year competitive contract for ATIP consultant services; </li>

				<h4 id="bb"> 2. Processing of Formal Requests </h4>
				<h5 id="bba"> 2.1 Summary </h5>
				<p> All formal access requests are forwarded to the ATIP Directorate where they are reviewed for clarity and processed for conformity with the legislation. Each request is then assigned to an organizational sector of the Department, which becomes responsible for locating and retrieving the records containing the information sought, and assisting in determining the costs and fees for processing the request. </p>
				<p> After a review of the relevant records, the organizational sector is responsible for formulating recommendations on the disclosure of the information. Before a final decision is reached, they are evaluated by the ATIP Directorate and any necessary consultations with other organizations are undertaken. This review process is intended to ensure consistency in the treatment of <em>Access to Information Act</em> requests. </p>
				<p> Once a decision has been rendered, the ATIP Directorate notifies the requester and arranges to provide access to all of the records that can be disclosed. </p>

				<h6> 3.2.2 Informal Review of Records </h6>
				<p> Also not reflected in the annual reports' statistical tables are the fifty (50) requests received from the various branches of the Department for the review of information on an informal basis. In general, these informal reviews relate to internal audit reports. In total 4,292&nbsp;pages were reviewed. </p>
				<h6> 3.2.3 Document Collection </h6>
				<p> In addition, eight (8) requests were made from Parliament and Justice Canada for the collection of records in accordance with Parliamentary motions or external requirements for litigation purposes. In total 10,917&nbsp;pages were reviewed for these exercises. </p>

				<h5 id="bcc"> 3.3 Disposition of Completed Requests </h5>
				<p> Although 951 requests were completed during the 2004-2005 reporting period, an additional 187 requests were carried over to the next fiscal year. </p>
				<p> Of the 951 cases where the Department completed the request, information was released either in whole or in part in 632 requests (66.5 per cent). </p>
				<h6> 3.3.1 All Disclosed </h6>
				<p> In 144 of the 951 completed cases (15 per cent), the requesters were provided with full access to the relevant records. This figure is down slightly from last fiscal year (20 per cent). </p>
				<h6> 3.3.2 Disclosed in Part </h6>
				<p> In an additional 488 of the 951 completed cases (51&nbsp;per cent), PWGSC granted the requesters partial access. In most instances, the information withheld related to third party information. </p>
				<h6> 3.3.3 Nothing Disclosed (All Exempted; All Excluded) </h6>
				<p> In 26 of the 951 completed requests (2 per cent), there was no information released. </p>
				<h6> 3.3.4 Transferred </h6>
				<p> Of the 951 requests completed, 45 (5&nbsp;per cent) concerned records not under the control of the Department. After initial processing, these requests were transferred to the appropriate government institution in accordance with Section&nbsp;8 of the <em>Act</em>. </p>
				<h6> 3.3.5 Unable to Process </h6>
				<p> After initial review, the Department was unable to process 123&nbsp;requests. In most instances, this was because the Department did not have any records which related to the request. </p>
				<h6> 3.3.6 Abandoned by Applicant </h6>
				<p> Of the completed access requests, 121 were eventually considered to be abandoned. Such an action may occur at any stage of request processing. </p>
				<h6> 3.3.7 Treated Informally </h6>
				<p> There were 4 cases where it was determined that the information could be released informally rather than through the formal procedures of the <em>Act</em>. </p>
				<h5 id="bcd"> 3.4 Exemptions Invoked </h5>
				<p> With the exception of section 26, as noted in Annex A, the Department invoked exemptions under all sections of the <em>Act</em>. </p>
				<p> Annex A is intended to show the types of exemptions invoked to deny access. For example, if in one request 5&nbsp;different exemptions were used, one exemption under each relevant section would be reported for a total of 5&nbsp;exemptions. If the same exemption is used several times for the same request, it is reported only once. </p>
				<p> There remained several instances where PWGSC was prohibited from disclosing information. Subsection&nbsp;19(1) and paragraphs&nbsp;20(1)(b) and (c) of the <em>Act</em> continue to account for the great majority of the exemptions claimed by the Department. </p>
				<h5 id="bce"> 3.5 Exclusions Invoked </h5>
				<p> The <em>Act</em> does not apply to records considered to be confidences of the Queen's Privy Council pursuant to Section 69 of the <em>Act</em>. As in the case of exemptions, Annex&nbsp;A is intended to show the types of exclusions invoked to deny access. For example, if in one request five different exclusions are cited, one exclusion under each relevant section would be reported for a total of five. If the same exclusion is used several times for the same request, it is reported only once. </p>
				<p> In the 2004-2005 fiscal period, exclusions were applied pursuant to sections&nbsp;68 and 69 of the <em>Act</em> on 41 (4&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) of the total number of requests completed. </p>
				<h5 id="bcf"> 3.6 Completion Times </h5>
				<p> Despite the complexity of requests, the steady volume of access requests and increasing volume of consultations received, 394 out of 951 formal requests (41&nbsp;per cent) were completed within the initial 30-day period. This represents a slight decrease of 4 per cent when compared with the 2003-2004 fiscal year at which time 347 out of 776&nbsp;formal requests (45&nbsp;per cent) were completed within the initial 30-day period. </p>
				<h5 id="bcg"> 3.7 Extension of the Time Limits </h5>
				<p> The nature and source of information requested generally required extensive consultations and negotiations with third parties and other government institutions. In 713 of the requests processed (75 per cent), PWGSC was obliged under the legislation to extend the time limits pursuant to paragraphs&nbsp;9(1)(b) and (c) of the <em>Act</em> in order to conduct such consultations. </p>
				<p> In addition, extensions were undertaken in 74 of the requests processed (8&nbsp;per cent) pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;9(1)(a) of the <em>Act</em>. As in the 2003-2004 fiscal year, PWGSC continued to improve its performance in claiming legal time extensions permitted under the <em>Act</em>. </p>
				<h5 id="bch"> 3.8 Translations </h5>
				<p> There were no requests for the translation of information from one official language to another. </p>
				<h5 id="bci"> 3.9 Method of Access </h5>
				<p> The method by which requesters prefer to obtain access to information continues to be in the form of copies of documents. </p>
				<p> Of all requests in which information was released, the requesters received copies of the information they were seeking in 596 cases (94&nbsp;per cent). In 35 cases (6&nbsp;per cent) access was provided by a combination of copies and in-person examination and, in one case access was provided solely through in-person examination. It should be noted that the data in this section reflect only those requests in which information was disclosed either in part or in its entirety. </p>
				<p> <em>Although not reported in Annex&nbsp;A, in 13 cases (2&nbsp;per cent), information was provided to the applicant in alternate format (either on diskette, CD, or via e-mail).</em> </p>
				<h5 id="bcj"> 3.10 Fees </h5>
				<p> The <em>Access to Information Act</em> authorizes fees for certain activities related to the processing of formal requests under the <em>Act</em>. In addition to the $5 application fee, search, preparation and reproduction charges may apply to various records. Current fees are specified in the Access to Information Regulations. A written fee policy, specific to PWGSC, has been drafted and is in effect for the ATIP Directorate. </p>
				<p> No fees are imposed for reviewing records or for overhead or shipping. Moreover, in accordance with Section&nbsp;11 of the <em>Act</em>, no fees are charged for the first five hours required to search for a record or prepare any part of it for disclosure. </p>
				<p> There was a continued decrease in the amount of the fees collected for reproduction purposes and in the relation to the record searches. PWGSC waived fees for 57&nbsp;per cent of the requests received, representing a 2&nbsp;per cent decrease in the amount of fees waived since the last fiscal year. </p>
				<p> The fees collected during the reporting period totaled $14,376.70, while the fees waived in accordance with Subsection&nbsp;11(6) of the <em>Act</em> were $10,123.35. The decision to waive fees is made in accordance with the PWGSC Access to Information Request fee waiver policy. Fees collected this reporting year are estimated to represent one per cent of the total cost of the administration of the Access to Information program. </p>
				<h5 id="bck"> 3.11 Costs </h5>
				<p> Total salary costs associated with the program were $1,101,527 (54 per cent of the ATIP Directorate budget) for fiscal year 2004-2005. </p>
				<p> Total operations and maintenance costs, including consulting services, amounted to $933,834. </p>
				<p> The associated full-time equivalent (FTE) resources utilized were estimated at 18.57 for fiscal year 2004-2005. </p>
				<p> The three-year competitive contracts awarded to ARTAN Enterprises Ltd. And Excel HR in October, 2004, allowed the ATIP Directorate to have flexibility in managing sudden increases of requests while maintaining its level of service and the Department's compliance with the provisions of the <em>Act</em>. </p>

				<h5 id="bda"> 4.1 Complaints to the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada </h5>
				<p> The number of complaints filed with the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada increased from the previous fiscal year. </p>
				<p> Thirty (31 per cent) out of the ninety-six (96) complaints received related to time extensions taken on requests, twenty-six (27&nbsp;per cent) related to delays in responding to requests, and a total of twenty-two (23&nbsp;per cent), related to information withheld.

				<h6> 4.2.3 Judicial Reviews Completed in this Fiscal Year </h6>
				<p> One 2000-2001 fiscal year request for judicial review (Federal Court File Number <strong>T-2337-00</strong>) was filed by Brookfield Lepage Johnson Controls (BLJC). BLJC objected to PWGSC's decision to disclose information concerning its contract, claiming that the information qualified for exemption pursuant to paragraphs&nbsp;20(1)(b) and (c) of the Act. The trial division ruled in favour of disclosing the records. BLJC filed Applications for Leave to Appeal to the Court of Appeal (Federal Court File Number&nbsp;A-164-04) and subsequently to the Supreme Court of Canada (Supreme Court File Number SCC-30486). The applications were dismissed and the records disclosed to the applicant on March&nbsp;18, 2005. </p>
				<p> One 2001-2002 fiscal year request for judicial review (Federal Court File Number <strong>T-1409-01</strong> and <strong>A-225-03</strong>) was filed by the High-Rise Group Incorporated. The High-Rise Group Incorporated objected to PWGSC's decision to disclose a portion of its bid proposal for a new federal office building in the Hamilton, Ontario area. It claimed that the information qualified for exemption pursuant to paragraphs&nbsp;20(1)(b) and (c) of the <em>Act</em>. The trial division accepted the High-Rise Group Incorporated's argument and concluded that the net present value should remain exempt pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;20(1)(b). The appeal, filed by PWGSC, was heard on February 19, 2004. The Court of Appeal ruled in favour of PWGSC's position and concluded that net present values can be disclosed. The High-Rise Group Incorporated did not appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court of Canada and, as a result, the net present values were disclosed to the applicant. </p>
				<p> One 2002-2003 fiscal year request for judicial review (Federal Court File Number <strong>T-808-02</strong>) was filed by Aventis Pasteur Limited. Aventis Pasteur Limited objected to PWGSC's decision to release information pertaining to its contract for vaccines, claiming that the information should be exempted pursuant to paragraphs&nbsp;20(1)(b) and 20(1)(c) of the <em>Act</em>. In October, 2004, the Judge ruled in favour of the objections raised by Aventis Pasteur Limited. </p>

				<h3 id="c"> Part III: Reading Rooms </h3>
				<p> Section 71 of the <em>Act</em> requires government institutions to provide facilities where the Public may inspect manuals used by employees of the Department in administering or carrying out programs or activities. Consequently, reading rooms are provided by PWGSC at headquarters and in all regional offices. In these locations, the Public can access departmental manuals, the Government of Canada's <em>Info Source</em> publication, request forms and general information on how to exercise its rights under the <em>Act</em>. </p>
				<p> The ATIP Directorate is reviewing the Department's manuals with a view to providing the Public with electronic access to them in the future. </p>
				<h3 id="d">Part IV: Report on The <em>Privacy Act</em></h3>
				<h4 id="da"> 1. Organization of the Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) Directorate </h4>
				<p> The ATIP Directorate administers the provisions of the <em>Privacy Act</em> for Public Works and Government Services Canada, including two Special Operating Agencies, namely the Translation Bureau and Consulting and Audit Canada. </p>
				<h5 id="daa"> 1.1 Delegation Instruments </h5>
				<p> Under Section 3 of the <em>Privacy Act</em>, the Minister of the Department is designated as the head of the government institution for the purposes of the administration of the <em>Act</em>. </p>
				<p> The delegation instrument continued to be based on a centralized process with the ATIP Director responsible for full delegation with the exception of paragraph&nbsp;8(2)(m) of the <em>Privacy Act</em>. In 2004-2005, the Chief, Privacy, Policy and GOL was granted limited delegation pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;14(a) (nil replies only) and sections&nbsp;15 of the <em>Act</em>. The Director of the Cheque Redemption and Control Directorate in Matane, Quebec shares administrative powers under paragraph 8(2)(e) of the <em>Act</em> in regard to releasing original cheques to law enforcement bodies. This provides administrative flexibility in processing requests for cheques. </p>
				<h5 id="dab"> 1.2 Departmental Policies </h5>
				<p> Departmental Policy 002 sets out the Access to Information and Privacy delegation of authority order, definitions and the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders within PWGSC. An annex to the policy has been developed to outline the administrative attribution of powers and the Departmental guidelines and procedures with respect to the disclosure of certain personal information pursuant to subsection&nbsp;8(2) of the <em>Privacy Act</em>. Paragraphs&nbsp;(8)(2)(j) and (m) of the <em>Act</em> continue to be delegated by the Minister pursuant to section&nbsp;73 of the <em>Act</em>. The policy was revised during this fiscal year and is pending Management Board approval. </p>
				<p> Departmental Policy 014 sets out the definitions and the roles and responsibilities of employees with respect to the protection of personal and private information in the workplace. The policy was updated during the fiscal year. </p>

				<h4 id="dc"> 3. Privacy Impact Assessments </h4>
				<p> The Treasury Board of Canada approved the <em>Privacy Impact Assessment</em> (PIA) <em>Policy</em>, with an effective date of May&nbsp;2, 2002. The goal of the policy is to allow government institutionsto identify whether a program or a service delivery initiative, involving the collection, use or disclosure of personal information as defined in the <em>Privacy Act</em>, complies with the current privacy principles and to avoid or mitigate any identifiable risks to privacy. </p>
				<p> The ATIP Directorate has developed a departmental PIA framework and a draft departmental policy that clearly outline the process as well as the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders with respect to PIAs. Project managers have followed the framework and the draft policy when conducting their PIAs. The policy is pending approval of Management Board. </p>
				<p> The ATIP Directorate provides advice and guidance to PWGSC managers throughout the PIA process, including the review of draft/final PIA versions and provision of timely feedback, in addition to liaising with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. </p>
				<p> PIAs are required when a program or service is contracted out to the private sector. Currently, when the PWGSC Legal Services review contractual terms and conditions, they inform the contracting officers to contact the ATIP Directorate to advise on the need for a PIA. The ATIP Directorate informs the contracting officers to check with their client departments and provides the name and telephone number of the client department's ATIP Coordinator. Whether or not a PIA is warranted, the PWGSC ATIP Directorate also advises if the Department may proceed with the procurement process depending on the nature of the services and advises on the requirement to include appropriate security and privacy clauses in the documents. </p>
				<p> A partnership has been established with the IT Security Directorate and the Government On-Line Program Office to assess PIAs within an integrated risk management framework and to provide managers with a &quot;one stop shop&quot; for the identification of their PIA, Statement of Sensitivities (SOS) and Threat and Risks Assessment (TRA) requirements. </p>
				<p> As the authority to approve PIA's rests with the Deputy Minister, a status report on the progress of individual PIAs is provided to the Deputy Minister's Office on a monthly basis. PIA issues are discussed, as required, at the regular weekly ATIP meetings. </p>
				<p> In collaboration with the Information Technology Services Branch, the ATIP Directorate launched its Internet web site in January&nbsp;2005. </p>
				<p> The site is available at the following address: <a href="/aiprp-atip/index-eng.html">Access to Information and Privacy Programs</a>. Its use, which is intended to facilitate the public's understanding of the Acts and associated departmental procedures, will soon include the publication of summaries of results of all PIA reports conducted by PWGSC. </p>
				<p> In fiscal year 2004-2005, the ATIP Directorate was involved in several departmental initiatives that required the development of PIAs and Preliminary PIAs (PPIAs). Compared to 2003-2004, PWGSC experienced a substantial increase in the total number of PIAs/PPIAs initiated. This is mainly due to the transfer of certain responsibilities to PWGSC from the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat and the former Communications Canada. </p>

				<h5> <a name="dca" id="dca"></a>3.1 PIAs Completed </h5>
				<p> Billing Payment Services - This service will accept, capture and store payments received from individuals for services provided by federal departments and agencies. It includes the provision of lock boxes and imaging services to various departments and credit card authorization. </p>
				<p> The final PIA was approved by the Deputy Minister and sent to the Privacy Commissioner in October 2004. </p>
				<p> Integrated Information System (IIS) - This new Translation Bureau on-line ordering system integrates the former web-based Order Entry Service with the Activity Management System. The IIS is designed to track the hours spent on each project for billing purposes and also for determining each Translator's eligibility for an incentive bonus. </p>
				<p> A PIA was drafted and an advance copy sent to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) prior to IIS implementation on April&nbsp;26, 2004. The PIA was revised to incorporate the preliminary feedback that was received from the OPC in June 2004. The final PIA was approved by the Deputy Minister and sent to the Privacy Commissioner in October 2004. </p>
				<p> <em>Shared Travel Services Initiative (STSI) Program</em> - The Government of Canada is modernizing its corporate travel policy, services, processes and systems. To that end, it has awarded a contract to Team AcXess for the provision of an end-to-end travel solution where complementary and interoperable services would permit federal government employees and arrangers to easily access and obtain travel and travel-related services. STSI was implemented in April 2005. </p>
				<p> The final PIA was approved by the Deputy Minister and sent to the Privacy Commissioner in October 2004. </p>
				<p> Task Network Mapping Project - To do effective continuity planning for the CS community, the Information Technology Services Branch (ITSB) needs to understand vulnerabilities regarding information flows and to be cognizant of informal task networks. The Task Network Mapping tools can provide relevant insights on these issues and can: identify Primary Information Providers, where they reside across a recently reorganized workplace, in key disciplines, and the relative extent of dependencies on these people for information; pinpoint where imminent retirement or loss of these information sources will present obstacles to achieving ITSB goals; and give evidence of emergent communities of practice. </p>
				<p> Although the PIA was completed, the project was subsequently cancelled and the file was closed. </p>
				<h5 id="dcb"> 3.2 Ongoing PIAs </h5>
				<p> Canada Site - A PIA has been drafted concerning the Canada Site, which is the primary Internet portal for information about Canada and on the Government of Canada programs, services, new initiatives and products. Through its Web server logs and site features, the Canada Site collects personal information that is of relatively low sensitivity, including user comments, targeted surveys, customization and e-mail notifications. The Canada Site has been in place for a number of years, with features added since March 2002. </p>
				<p> Canada Enquiry Centre (CEC) - A PIA has commenced regarding the CEC. The CEC has been in place since 1982. It provides telephone and e-mail services to the Canada Site, Canadians and Non-Canadians gateways and several clusters as part of the GOL initiative. It includes: Telephone user support through 1-800-O-Canada; Customized Information Services; and GOL user support, including the Canada Site. </p>
				<p> Compensation Web Applications (CWA) - Release 2 - This Compensation Sector project involves a phased roll-out to all departments starting in April 2005, which will permit employees to access their pension benefits and pay information over the Web. This project includes the following applications: Statement of Pension and Group Benefits Plan; Pension Calculator; Buy Back Estimator; Pay Stubb on the Web; Compensation Advisor Access to Web Applications for Employees; and Compensation Common Services Database/Classification Reform. </p>
				<p> A PIA has been developed to review the new applications introduced to this service and also to address the issues raised by the Privacy Commissioner on the Release&nbsp;1 PIA. The summary of the results of this updated PIA is being prepared for publication on the ATIP Directorate Web site. </p>
				<p> E-Book Store - A PIA has begun to review potential privacy issues related to the Government of Canada e-Book Store. The initiative is scheduled to be implemented in the next fiscal year. E-Book Store is designed to leverage the cataloguing expertise of the Depository Services Program and the publishing and marketing expertise of Canadian Government Publishing to create &quot;one-stop-shopping&quot; for Government of Canada publications. </p>
				<p> Government of Canada Market Place - This project will provide a market service to authorized government users to electronically select and purchase goods and services, make the necessary payments and carry out the associated settlement. The first phase of this project is proposed to be implemented in the fall of 2005. </p>
				<p> A PIA has been drafted and an advance copy was sent to the OPC in April 2005 to obtain preliminary feedback prior to finalizing the report. </p>
				<p> Harmonization of Control Goods Program (CGP) and Industrial Security Program (ISP) A PIA has been drafted to review the proposed integration of certain aspects of the programs that would involve minimal integration of technology, personal forms and procedures - all within the confines of PWGSC - while keeping the purposes distinct. </p>
				<p> Ministerial and Deputy Ministerial Correspondence Tracking System (CCM Mercury) - A PIA is currently underway to review the privacy risks related to the system that is used to create profiles on Ministerial and Deputy Ministerial correspondence items. The system tracks the correspondence addressee, as well as all the actions taken on the letter until it returns to the Minister or Deputy minister for signature. The original letter and the response are also scanned into the CCM Mercury and Electronic Document and Records Management (EDRM) systems. </p>
				<p> Publiservice Website Services - PWGSC offers Canadians and public servants a single- window access to the Government of Canada (GoC) through various communications services. One such service is the Intranet portal known as Publiservice, which is a network designed to help public servants better serve the GoC and Canadian citizens. </p>
				<p> Publiservice Jobs Site - An important component of Publiservice is the Public Service Staffing Notices site, commonly referred to as the Jobs Site. The Jobs Site is only made available to Government of Canada employees. This site lists job opportunities within the Government of Canada and allows interested candidates to apply on-line and also to be notified of new postings. A PIA has been initiated to review privacy implications related to the personal information collected on the Publiservice Jobs Site. </p>
				<p> Secure Channel, Common Registration Service (CRS) Core - This is a Government On-Line project that was initiated due to an anticipated expansion of the use of &quot;epasses&quot;. An &quot;epass&quot; is a certificate or pass that allows the general public to securely obtain services through a government program web site. It requires the authentication mechanisms to access &quot;shared secrets&quot; from the specific department to whom the application is being used. Additional functionality has also been introduced into the business authentication model. </p>
				<p> Although a PIA has been prepared on this project, it will not be sent to the Privacy Commissioner because the next version (CRS 6) has already been drafted. Nevertheless, the CRS Core PIA and the CRS 6 PIA will be made available for the Privacy Commissioner's review. </p>
				<p> Truncation and Electronic Cheque Presentment (TECP) -The Canadian Payments Association is sponsoring an industry-wide initiative to implement a cost effective and secure process to replace the current physical exchange of cheques and other paper items between financial institutions in Canada. This initiative will have major impacts on the Standard Payment System (SPS), the Government Banking System (GBS) and the Cheque Redemption and Control Directorate (CRCD). The use of imaging in conjunction with electronic presentment will contribute to the goal of reducing the movement of paper and allow financial institutions and the Receiver General to expand automated processing and create options for storage, archiving and convenient retrieval of paper images. </p>
				<p> The Final PIA was approved by the Deputy Minister and sent to the Privacy Commissioner in May 2005. </p>

				<h5 id="dcc"> 3.3 Update on PIAs Completed in Previous Fiscal Years </h5>
				<p> Foreign Banking Services - This is another Receiver General service that routes payments for items such as Income Tax Refunds, Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) payments to recipients living outside Canada. PWGSC contracted with the Bank of America in Canada to provide this service which began on January&nbsp;12, 2004. </p>
				<p> The final PIA was approved by the Deputy Minister and sent to the Privacy Commissioner in October 2003. </p>
				<p> The reply was received from the Privacy Commissioner in April 2005 confirming that the Department generally respected the principles of the <em>Privacy Act</em> and that the risk factors to personal information had been largely addressed. The Privacy Commissioner also made five recommendations relating to the protection of the personal information that is collected, used, disclosed and stored via this initiative. These recommendations are being reviewed by the project authority. </p>
				<p> Receiver General Buy Button (RGBB) - This endeavour provides a bridge, in the form of an Internet page, between government departments and a third party service provider, to allow credit card payment authorizations. </p>
				<p> The PIA was approved by the Deputy Minister in February 2003. Although a formal response had not been received from the Privacy Commissioner on this project, the pilot storefront was put into production on May&nbsp;20, 2003. </p>
				<p> The response from the Privacy Commissioner was received in June 2004 and noted that all privacy concerns had been addressed to their satisfaction. The Public Summary is being finalized for publication on the ATIP Directorate Web site. </p>
				<h5> <a name="dcd" id="dcd"></a>3.4 Preliminary PIAs (PPIAs) </h5>
				<p> A PPIA may be completed when the detailed information required for a comprehensive assessment is not yet available. Also, in exceptional circumstances, a PPIA may be undertaken instead of a full PIA when the proposed initiative does not seem to raise privacy issues. </p>
				<p> Last fiscal year, the ATIP Directorate was involved in the following initiatives for which the Department has decided to prepare PPIAs. </p>
				<p> <strong>eContact</strong> - The ATIP Directorate has recommended that a PPIA be conducted regarding this online tool that will enable multiple call centres to share their resource directories, to provide a better response to public enquiries outside a call centre's jurisdiction. It is also developing an Internet interface to provide the public with a discovery tool for inter- jurisdictional contact information. </p>
				<p> GOC My Account - This Public Access Program is the &quot;access layer&quot; from which users will be able to create a personalized list of online government services. Users will be given the ability to add or remove selected online programs and services links. Using their epass to login, users will also have online access to departmental or program specific applications. The GOC My Account was implemented in April 2005. </p>
				<p> The Preliminary PIA (PPIA) was sent to the Office of the Privacy Commission (OPC) in February 2005. </p>
				<p> Information Protection Centre (IPC) - A PPIA is ongoing concerning the departmental IPC. The IPC is responsible for the protection and security of departmental and shared government information systems. The IPC delivers the following services: Intrusion Detection System (IDS); Vulnerability Assessment; Threat Monitoring; and Computer Security Incident Handling. </p>
				<p> IT Shared Services Initiative (SSI) - A PPIA has been initiated regarding the provision of IT shared services to the Public Service Commission (PSC), the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages (OCOL) and the School of Canada Public Services (SCPS). </p>
				<p> Secure Channel, Information Exchange Facility Concept - This new service consists of software that permits an individual who is seeking to register with one particular institution or one service (where no other institution is involved) to pull information from another institution or service. The objective is to remove the need to re-key or re-enter duplicate information through the use of this concept. </p>
				<p> The PPIA undertaken on this concept was sent to the OPC in February 2005. Feedback from the OPC was received in April 2005 recommending that a full PIA be conducted. </p>
				<p> Secure Channel, Information Protection Centre (SC IPC) - The purpose of the SC IPC is to improve upon the existing information infrastructure protection capabilities of the SC Secure Operations Centre, in the following technology areas: Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS); Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS); File Integrity (FI) System; and, Malicious Code Defence (MCD). </p>
				<p> The PPIA was sent to the OPC in December 2004. </p>
				<p> Secure Channel, Quebec Proof of Concept - A PPIA has been undertaken to assess the feasibility of the proposed integration of the &quot;Service Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois d'Authentification Gouvernemental (SQAG)&quot; into the Secure Channel CRS Core Services. </p>
				<p> Secure Channel, Secure Message Routing Service (SMRS) - Phase&nbsp;I - A PPIA has been drafted on SMRS whose function is to provide secure delivery of sensitive data between government departments/applications. SMRS will allow data (notifications) to be sent from provider organizations to subscriber organizations, as well as allow subscriber organization to query information providers for relevant data elements. </p>
				<p> Trusted Data Store (TDS) - A PPIA is underway to review the proposed long-term vision composed of a common trusted identity system for federal government employees and a single authentication and authorization system. The TDS would serve as a central repository and be populated with certain data elements extracted from the Compensation Web Application (CWA) Shared Secrets Database (SSDB) at the time that a G-Pass is issued. </p>

				<h4 id="dd"> 4. Statistical Report: Interpretation and Explanation of Trends </h4>
				<p> Applicants can generally have access to their personal information on an informal basis by contacting the manager of the program area who controls the records. In these instances, the ATIP Directorate provides assistance and advice on an &quot;as required&quot; basis. Although not reflected in the statistical tables, 8 requests were submitted by management during the fiscal year for the informal review of documents prior to their proactive disclosure to the individuals concerned. A total of 777 pages was reviewed and 366 pages were recommended for release on an informal basis. This represents a 26 per cent decrease in the number of requests for informal reviews from the previous year. </p>
				<p> It is the practice of PWGSC to process requests formally where the information is sensitive and may be subject to an exemption or an exclusion pursuant to sections&nbsp;18 through 28, 69 and 70 of the <em>Act</em>. </p>
				<h5> <a name="dda" id="dda"></a> 4.1 Requests under the <em>Privacy Act</em> </h5>
				<p> There were 63 requests filed under the <em>Privacy Act</em> in 2004-2005. The majority of cases related to subjects such as pension and pay (29&nbsp;per cent), employee personnel records, including competitions and grievances (25&nbsp;per cent), and other personal information pertaining to the applicants (19&nbsp;per cent). The remaining cases related to investigations (16&nbsp;per cent) and security clearances (11&nbsp;per cent). </p>
				<p> In addition, 4 government institutions consulted with PWGSC on 4 different cases. These cases accounted for 6&nbsp;per cent of the ATIP Directorate's privacy caseload. </p>
				<p> Compared to 2003-2004, PWGSC continued to experienced a decrease (16&nbsp;percent) in the total number of privacy requests received. No corrections or notations were sought by requesters pursuant to the terms of the <em>Act</em>. </p>

				<h5 id="ddb"> 4.2 Disposition of Completed Requests </h5>
				<p> Of the 75 requests processed, 71 (95 per cent) were completed during the 2004-2005 reporting period. The remaining 4&nbsp;requests (5&nbsp;per cent) were not completed as of March&nbsp;31, 2005. </p>
				<p> Taking into account only those cases where the Department was able to process the request, information was released either in whole or in part in 76&nbsp;per cent of the cases. </p>
				<p> The completed requests are categorized as follows: </p>
				<h6> 4.2.1 All Disclosed </h6>
				<p> In 5 of the 71 completed cases (7&nbsp;per cent), the requesters were provided with total access to the relevant records. </p>
				<h6> 4.2.2 Disclosed in Part </h6>
				<p> In 49 instances (69&nbsp;per cent), the requesters were granted partial access. </p>
				<h6> 4.2.3 Nothing Disclosed <em>(All Exempted or All Excluded)</em> </h6>
				<p> There were 4 requests (6&nbsp;per cent) where all the information was withheld (exempted). </p>
				<h6> 4.2.4 Transferred </h6>
				<p> Of the requests received, none concerned records under the control of another department. </p>
				<h6> 4.2.5 Unable to Process </h6>
				<p> After initial review, the Department was unable to process requests in 9 cases (13&nbsp;per cent). In most instances, this was because the Department did not have any records that were relevant to the request. </p>
				<h6> 4.2.6 Abandoned by the Applicant </h6>
				<p> Of the completed requests, 4 were considered to be abandoned (6&nbsp;per cent). Such an action may occur at any stage of the request processing. </p>
				<div class="topPage"> <a href="#tphp" title="Return to Top of Page"><img src="/clf20/images/tphp.gif" alt="" height="12" width="19" /><br />
					Top of Page</a> </div>
				<h5 id="ddc"> 4.3 Exemptions Invoked </h5>
				<p> As noted in Annex B, exemptions were invoked under section&nbsp;21, paragraphs&nbsp;22(1)(a) and (b), sections&nbsp;26 and 27 of the <em>Act</em>. The majority of the exemptions invoked was under section 26 (Information about another individual) of the <em>Act</em>. </p>
				<p> Annex B is intended to show the types of exemptions invoked to deny access. For example, if in one request five different exemptions were used, one exemption under each relevant section would be reported for a total of five exemptions. If the same exemption is used several times for the same request, it is reported only once. </p>
				<h5 id="ddd"> 4.4 Exclusion</h5>
				<p> The <em>Act</em> does not apply to records considered to be confidences of the Queen's Privy Council pursuant to section&nbsp;70 of the <em>Act</em>. As in the case of exemptions, Annex&nbsp;B is intended to show the types of exclusions invoked to deny access. For example, if in one request 5&nbsp;different exclusions are cited, one exclusion under each relevant section would be reported for a total of 5. If the same exclusion is used several times for the same request, it is reported only once. </p>
				<p> No exclusion was cited in dealing with Privacy requests. </p>
				<h5 id="dde"> 4.5 Completion Time </h5>
				<p> Forty cases (56 per cent) were completed within the first 30&nbsp;days. Twenty-two (31&nbsp;per cent) were completed within 31 to 60&nbsp;days from the date of receipt by the Department. The remaining 9&nbsp;cases (13&nbsp;per cent) were completed beyond 60&nbsp;days. </p>
				<h5 id="ddf"> 4.6 Extensions </h5>
				<p> Time extensions were required and taken on 20&nbsp;cases. In 17&nbsp;cases, there was the need to consult with other government departments. For the remaining 3&nbsp;cases, meeting the original time limit would have unreasonably interfered with the operations of the institution. </p>
				<h5 id="ddg"> 4.7 Translations </h5>
				<p> There were no requests for the translation of information from one official language to another. </p>
				<h5 id="ddh"> 4.8 Method of Access </h5>
				<p> Copies of the records were given in response to 54&nbsp;requests (76&nbsp;per cent). It should be noted that this category reflects only those requests where the information was <em>all disclosed</em> or <em>disclosed in part</em>. </p>
				<h5 id="ddi"> 4.9 Corrections and Notations </h5>
				<p> No requests for corrections or notations were received. </p>
				<h5 id="ddj"> 4.10 Costs </h5>
				<p> The amount of time devoted by ATIP Directorate staff to privacy issues, including the provision of advice, is similar to the last fiscal year. </p>
				<p> Total salary costs associated with Privacy issues were $295,845 and operational and maintenance costs were $70,289 for a total cost of $366,134. The associated full-time equivalent resources utilization was 4.70 for 2004-2005. </p>

				<h5 id="dea"> 5.1 Complaints to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada </h5>
				<p> The ATIP Directorate continued to see a decrease in the number of complaints made to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada in the 2004-2005 fiscal year. </p>
				<h6> 5.1.1 New Complaints Received in 2004-2005 </h6>
				<p> Of the four&nbsp;(4) complaints lodged with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner during the fiscal year, two (2) complaints related to exemptions applied in response to privacy requests. The other two (2) complaints were made against the Department from two (2) individuals; one concerned the collection of personal information on a traveller profile in order to obtain a Travel Identification Number (TIN), and the other related to the improper disclosure of personal information. It is noteworthy that there were no challenges to the time extensions that had been taken pursuant to section&nbsp;15 of the <em>Privacy Act</em>. </p>
				<h6> 5.1.2 Complaints Completed in 2004-2005 </h6>
				<p> Seven (7) investigations relating to the complaints received by PWGSC in this and prior fiscal years were concluded during the fiscal year. Of those, four (4) complaints (57&nbsp;per cent) which related to exemptions and improper disclosure were considered to have been &quot;settled in the course of the investigation&quot;, two (29&nbsp;per cent) which concerned missing records and exemptions were determined to be &quot;not well founded&quot;, and one (14&nbsp;per cent) which related to missing records was &quot;resolved or well founded&quot;. </p>
				<h5 id="deb"> 5.2 Requests for Judicial Review </h5>
				<p> There were no requests made to the Federal Court of Canada seeking a judicial review of decisions taken. </p>
