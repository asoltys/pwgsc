				<h3 id="a">Preface</h3>
				<p>The <em>Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act</em> (Revised Statutes of Canada, Chapter&nbsp;A-1, 1985) were proclaimed on July&nbsp;1, 1983.</p>
				<p>The <em>Access to Information Act</em> gives Canadian citizens and individuals present in Canada a broad right of access to information contained in government records subject to certain specific and limited exceptions.</p>
				<p>The <em>Privacy Act</em> extends to individuals the right of access to information about themselves held by the government, again subject to specific and limited exceptions.  The law also protects the individual's privacy by controlling access to personal information and gives individuals substantial say over its collection and use.</p>
				<p>Section 72 of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> and section&nbsp;72 of the <em>Privacy Act</em> require that the head of every government institution shall prepare for submission to Parliament an annual report on the administration of the Acts within the institution during each fiscal year.</p>
				<p>These Annual Reports provide a summary of the management and administration of the <em>Access to Information</em> and the <em>Privacy Act</em> within Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) for the fiscal year 2005-2006.</p>

				<h3 id="aa">PART I: Background</h3>
				<h4 id="aaa">1. Public Works and Government Services Canada
					(PWGSC)</h4>
				<p>Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) was created in 1993 through the amalgamation of former Public Works Canada (PWC), Supply and Services Canada (SSC), Government Telecommunications Agency, and the Translation Bureau (Secretary of State of Canada).</p>
				<p>During the 2005-2006 fiscal year, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> has undergone some organizational changes, as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>On September 12, 2005, the Public Access Programs Sector of the Government Information Services Branch was transferred to Service Canada, including 1&nbsp;800&nbsp;O-Canada, the Canada Site (Canada.gc.ca Internet site), Gateways and Clusters, and Publiservice (the Government of Canada Intranet).</li>
					<li>On October 21, 2005, Consulting and Audit Canada services were realigned. The agency now exclusively provides audit and assurance services, while government consulting and corporate services were transferred to the Government Information Services Branch.</li>
					<li>On February 20, 2006, the functions of the Service Integration Branch were reassigned to various <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> business lines and each of the Regions (namely the Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, Western, and Pacific) now report directly to the Deputy Minister of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As the major provider of central and common services to the Government of Canada, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> delivers its services through the following organizations:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Accounting, Banking and Compensation Branch</li>
					<li>Acquisitions Branch</li>
					<li>Government Information Services Branch</li>
					<li>Information Technology Services Branch</li>
					<li>Office of Greening Government Operations</li>
					<li>Real Property Branch</li>
				</ul>
				<p>As well, two Special Operating Agencies within <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> deliver their services in a more market-oriented, cost-recovery basis: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Consulting and Audit Canada</li>
					<li>Translation Bureau</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Internal services and management oversight supporting <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s corporate level are carried out by the following branches:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Audit and Evaluation Branch </li>
					<li>Corporate Services, Policy, and Communications Branch</li>
					<li>Finance Branch</li>
					<li>Human Resources Branch</li>
					<li>Investigation and Litigation Support Office</li>
					<li>Legal Services Branch</li>
					<li>Office of the Chief Risk Officer</li>
					<li>Strategic Transformation Branch</li>

				<h3 id="b">Part II: Report on the <em>Access to Information Act</em></h3>
				<h4 id="ba">1. Organization of the Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) Directorate</h4>
				<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate administers the provisions of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> for <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, including the two Special Operating Agencies.</p>
				<p>For most of the 2005-2006 fiscal year, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate has operated with seven&nbsp;separate teams in order to better manage the types of requests received within the Department. Overseeing these teams and reporting to the Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, is the Manager, Risk and Quality Management.  Three of the teams are responsible for processing <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> requests, complaints, and court cases received by the Department.  One team is committed to dealing with privacy and policy, a team is responsible for training of new recruits to the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate and the processing of <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> requests, and another is responsible for ongoing special projects and the training of departmental managers and staff on the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> legislation.  Finally, one team is involved with all of the administrative functions conducted by the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate.</p>
				<h5><a name="baa" id="baa"></a> 1.1 Delegation Instruments</h5>
				<p>Under Section 3 of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>, the
					Minister of the Department is designated as the head of the government
					institution for the purposes of the administration of the <em>Act.</em></p>
				<p>The delegation instrument continued to be based on a centralized process with the Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, responsible for full delegation of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>.  In February 2005, certain administrative functions were delegated to the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Chiefs.  This delegation has been limited to the following provisions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Paragraph 7(a) - Respond to request for access (nil reply only)</li>
					<li>Subsection 8(1) - Transfer to and from other government institutions</li>
					<li>Section 9 - Extension of time limits</li>
					<li>Subsections 11(2) to 11(6) - Additional fees and fee waiver</li>
					<li>Section 27 - Notification to third parties</li>
				</ul>
				<h5 id="bab">1.2 Responsibilities of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate</h5>
				<p>The Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, reports to the Director General of Executive Secretariat, who, in turn, reports to the Assistant Deputy Minister of the Corporate Services, Policy and Communications Branch.</p>
				<p>The responsibilities of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate include the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>managing all activities within <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> relating to the operation of the <em>Act</em>, as well as the regulations, directives and guidelines pursuant to them;</li>
					<li>developing, producing and promulgating departmental ATI policies, procedures, standards and guidelines;</li>
					<li>developing and delivering awareness training to <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> managers and employees to ensure departmental responsiveness to the legal obligations imposed on them by the <em>Act</em> and Regulations;</li>
					<li>reviewing departmental policies, procedures and agreements to ensure that they are in compliance with the provisions of the <em>Act</em> and making recommendations for amendments;</li>
					<li>defending institutional decisions on the administration of the <em>Act</em> during investigations conducted by the Information Commissioner and during judicial proceedings at the Federal Court of Canada and the Supreme Court of Canada;</li>
					<li>coordinating and approving the annual update of the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s descriptions of its organization and its record holdings for inclusion in the Treasury Board publication <em>Info Source</em>; </li>
					<li>reporting annually to Parliament in accordance with section&nbsp;72 of the <em>Act</em> and any instructions issued pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;70(1)(d) of the <em>Act</em>;</li>
					<li>acting as spokesperson for the Department in dealings with the Treasury Board Secretariat, the Information Commissioner of Canada and other government departments and agencies.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The administration of the legislation by the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate is also facilitated at the branch, sector, and regional office levels.  Each organizational sector has an <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Liaison Officer (normally reporting to an Assistant Deputy Minister, a Director General, or a Regional Director General) who coordinates activities and provides guidance on the operation of the <em>Act</em>, departmental directives and procedures.</p>

				<h5 id="bad">1.4. Summary of Activities and Highlights</h5>
				<h6>1.4.1 Information Sessions</h6>
				<p>Given the complex character of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> and the need to balance the public's right to access information with the need to protect the legitimate interests of other parties, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate provided guidance as well as information sessions, on an &quot;as required&quot; basis, to a total of 582&nbsp;employees in the National Capital Area and in the Atlantic, Western and Pacific Regions.</p>
				<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate has also contributed as presenters to the Management Orientation course.  A total of five presentations were made to 125&nbsp;departmental managers to inform them of their roles and responsibilities under the Access to Information and Privacy legislation and policies.</p>
				<h6>1.4.2 Briefings</h6>
				<p>New senior management and ministerial exempt staff were briefed on their roles and responsibilities under the <em>Act</em>.  Additional briefings were conducted on an as required basis.</p>
				<p>Throughout the fiscal year, eight additional briefings were given to new <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Liaison Officers at the commencement of their duties as they were added to the departmental <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> network.</p>
				<h6>1.4.3 Credit/Debit Card</h6>
				<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Credit/Debit Card System continues to be used to facilitate the payment of fees by credit cards and debit cards, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Diners/Enroute and Interac.</p>
				<h6>1.4.4 Imaging Software Solution and Secret LAN</h6>
				<p>In order to better respond to requests, the increasingly large volume of records tosever, and to replace an obsolete severing photocopier, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate initiated a request for proposal and awarded a contract for the provision of an imaging software solution.  The imaging software solution will be implemented inthe early stages of the 2006-2007 fiscal year.</p>
				<p>Given the sensitivity of the records to be processed and stored electronically with the new imaging software solution, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate established a Secret Local Area Network (LAN) in order to meet the requirements of the Government Security Policy and Standards.</p>
				<h6>1.4.5 Upgrade of <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym><em>flow</em> Tracking System</h6>
				<p>To further meet the needs of both applicants and the Department, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate initiated the acquisition of an improved tracking system, AccessPro, along with a more stable server for the software application and data to reside.  The system upgrade is anticipated to be implemented during the 2006-2007 fiscal year.</p>
				<h6>1.4.6 <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Officer Development Program</h6>
				<p>The Human Resources Branch and <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate have collaborated to design an <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Officer Development Program.  The program is intended to address the department's mid and long-term shortages of <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> professionals by recruiting new and existing employees at the junior level, fostering their loyalty to <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, and preparing them to fill senior <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Officer positions within a three&nbsp;year horizon.  This would increase the Directorate's efficiency and reduce the costs associated with the competitive staffing process and the use of consultants.</p>
				<p>It is anticipated that Deputy Minister approval and staffing of the first candidates will take place during the 2006-2007 fiscal year.</p>
				<h6>1.4.7 National Master Standing Offer for <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Consultants</h6>
				<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Community has a continuous need for the services of qualified <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> professionals who can assist in meeting the legislative requirements imposed by the Acts on an &quot;as required&quot; basis.  To that end, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate has initiated discussions with the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Acquisitions Branch in order to establish a National Master Standing Offer for qualified <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> professionals that can be used by all departments and agencies falling under the <em>Access to Information Act</em> and the <em>Privacy Act</em>.</p>
				<p>Collaboration between all government stakeholders and the procurement process will take place during the 2006-2007 fiscal year.</p>
				<h6>1.4.8 Special Studies</h6>
				<p><strong>Information Commissioner of Canada's Report Card</strong></p>
				<p>Since the Information Commissioner's 2002-2003 report card, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> has continued to review procedures and processes to improve the timely delivery ofinformation to the public, both on a formal and informal basis.  The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate developed a multi-year ATI Improvement Plan based on the recommendations made by the Information Commissioner of Canada. </p>

					<li>Imaging software solution and Secret LAN; and</li>
					<li>Contract for the upgrade of the current case management application, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym><em>flow</em>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The ongoing activities include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Ministerial support for the ATI program;</li>
					<li>Informing senior management of branch compliance rates on a quarterly basis;</li>
					<li>Increasing the number of training/briefing sessions given each year in the Department;</li>

				<h4 id="bb">2. Processing of Formal Requests</h4>
				<h5 id="bba">2.1 Summary</h5>
				<p>All formal access requests are forwarded to the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate where they are reviewed for clarity and processed for conformity with the legislation.  Each request is then assigned to an organizational sector of the Department, which becomes responsible for locating and retrieving the records containing the information sought, and assisting in determining the costs and fees for processing the request.</p>
				<p>After a review of the relevant records, the organizational sector is responsible for formulating recommendations on the disclosure of the information.  Before a final decision is reached, they are evaluated by the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate and any necessary consultations with other organizations are undertaken.  This review process is intended to ensure consistency in the treatment of <em>Access to Information Act</em> requests.  Once a decision has been rendered, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate notifies the requester and arranges to provide access to all of the records that can be disclosed.</p>

				<h6>3.2.3 Document Collection</h6>
				<p>In addition, nine requests were made from Parliament and Justice Canada for the collection of records in accordance with Parliamentary motions or external requirements for litigation purposes.  In total 12,509&nbsp;pages have been reviewed for these exercises. </p>

				<h5><a name="bcc" id="bcc"></a>3.3 Disposition of Completed Requests</h5>
				<p>Although 809 requests were completed during the 2005-2006 reporting period, an additional 209&nbsp;requests were carried forward to the next fiscal year.</p>
				<p>Of the 809 cases where the Department completed the request, information was released either in whole or in part in 515&nbsp;requests (64&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent).</p>
				<h6>3.3.1 All Disclosed</h6>
				<p>In 105 of the 809&nbsp;completed cases (13&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), the requesters were provided with full access to the relevant records.  This figure is down by two&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent from last fiscal year.</p>
				<h6>3.3.2 Disclosed in Part</h6>
				<p>In an additional 410 of the 809&nbsp;completed cases (51&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> granted the requesters partial access.  In most instances, the information withheld related to third party information.</p>
				<h6>3.3.3 Nothing Disclosed <em>(All Exempted; All Excluded)</em></h6>
				<p>In 20 of the 809 completed requests (two&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), there was no information released.</p>
				<h6>3.3.4 Transferred</h6>
				<p>Of the 809 requests completed, 62 (eight&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) concerned records not under the control of the Department.  After initial processing, these requests were transferred to the appropriate government institution in accordance with section&nbsp;8 of the <em>Act</em>.</p>
				<h6>3.3.5 Unable to Process</h6>
				<p>After initial review, the Department was unable to process 109&nbsp;requests (13&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent).  In most instances, this was because the Department did not have any records relating to the request.</p>
				<h6>3.3.6 Abandoned by Applicant</h6>
				<p>Of the completed access requests, 100 (12&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were eventually considered to be abandoned.  Such an action may occur at any stage of request processing.</p>
				<h6>3.3.7 Treated Informally</h6>
				<p>There were three cases (one&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) where it was determined that the information could be released informally rather than through the formal procedures of the <em>Act</em>.</p>
				<h5 id="bcd">3.4 Exemptions Invoked</h5>
				<p>With the exception of section&nbsp;26, as noted in Annex&nbsp;A, the Department invoked exemptions under all sections of the <em>Act</em>.</p>
				<p>Annex A is intended to show the types of exemptions invoked to deny access.  For example, if in one request five&nbsp;different exemptions were used, one exemption under each relevant section would be reported for a total of five&nbsp;exemptions.  If the same exemption isused several times for the same request, it is reported only once.</p>
				<p>There remained several instances where <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> was prohibited from disclosing information.  Subsection&nbsp;19(1) and paragraphs&nbsp;20(1)(b) and (c) of the <em>Act</em> continue to account for the great majority of the exemptions claimed by the Department.</p>
				<h5 id="bce">3.5 Exclusions Invoked</h5>
				<p>The Act does not apply to published material or material available for purchase by the public, library or museum material preserved solely for public record, material placed in the Library and Archives Canada, as well as records considered to be confidences of the Queen's Privy Council, pursuant to sections&nbsp;68 and 69 of the <em>Act</em> respectively.</p>
				<p>As in the case of exemptions, Annex&nbsp;A is intended to show the types of exclusions invoked to deny access.  For example, if in one request five&nbsp;different exclusions are cited, one exclusion under each relevant section would be reported for a total of five.  If the same exclusion is used several times for the same request, it is reported only once.</p>
				<p>In the 2005-2006 fiscal period, exclusions were applied pursuant to sections&nbsp;68 and 69 of the <em>Act</em> on 50 (six&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) of the total number of requests completed.</p>
				<h5 id="bcf">3.6 Completion Times</h5>
				<p>Despite the complexity of requests, the steady volume of access requests and increasing volume of consultations received, 391 out of the 809&nbsp;formal requests (48&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were completed within the initial 30-day period.  This represents an increase of seven&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent when compared with the 2004-2005 fiscal year.</p>
				<h5 id="bcg">3.7 Extension of the Time Limits</h5>
				<p>The nature and source of information requested generally required extensive consultations and negotiations with third parties and other government institutions.  In 507 of the 1,018&nbsp;requests processed (50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> extended the time limits pursuant to paragraphs&nbsp;9(1)(b) and (c) of the <em>Act</em> in order to conduct such consultations.</p>
				<p>In addition, extensions were undertaken in 52 of the requests processed (five&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;9(1)(a) of the <em>Act</em>.  As in the 2004-2005 fiscal year, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> continued to improve its performance in claiming legal time extensions permitted under the <em>Act</em>.</p>
				<h5 id="bch">3.8 Translations</h5>
				<p>There were no requests for the translation of information from one official language to another.</p>
				<h5 id="bci">3.9 Method of Access</h5>
				<p>The method by which requesters prefer to obtain access to information continues to be in the form of hard paper copies of documents.  Copies were also given on other media (i.e., diskettes, CDs, tapes).</p>
				<p>Of all the requests in which information was released, the requesters received copies of the information they were seeking in 490&nbsp;cases (95&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent).  In 22&nbsp;cases (four&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) access was provided by a combination of copies and in-person examination and, in three&nbsp;cases (one&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), access was provided solely through in-person examination.  It should be noted that the data in this section reflect only those requests in which information was<em> all disclosed</em> or <em>disclosed in part</em>.</p>
				<h5 id="bcj">3.10 Fees </h5>
				<p>The <em>Access to Information Act</em> authorizes fees for certain activities related to the processing of formal requests under the <em>Act</em>.  In addition to the $5 application fee, other charges may also apply for search, preparation and reproduction of the various records, as specified in the Access to Information Regulations.  A written fee policy, specific to <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, has been drafted and is in effect for the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate.</p>
				<p>No fees are imposed for reviewing records or for overhead or shipping.  Moreover, in accordance with section&nbsp;11 of the <em>Act</em>, no fees are charged for the first five&nbsp;hours required to search for a record or prepare any part of it for disclosure.</p>
				<p>There was a continued decrease in the amount of the fees collected for reproduction purposes and in relation to the record searches. <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> waived fees for 42&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the requests processed, representing a 15&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent decrease in the amount of fees waived since the last fiscal year.</p>
				<p>The fees collected during the reporting period totalled $26,589.57, while the fees waived in accordance with subsection&nbsp;11(6) of the <em>Act</em> were $6,241.90. The decision to waive fees is made in accordance with the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Access to Information Request Fee Waiver Policy.

				<h4 id="cc">3. Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA)</h4>
				<p>The Treasury Board of Canada approved the <em>Privacy Impact Assessment</em> (PIA) <em>Policy</em>, with an effective date of May&nbsp;2, 2002. The goal of the policy is to allow government institutions to identify whether a program or a service delivery initiative, involving the collection, use or disclosure of personal information as defined in the <em>Privacy Act</em>, complies with the privacy principles and to avoid or mitigate any identifiable risks to privacy.</p>
				<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate has developed a departmental PIA framework and a draft departmental policy that clearly outlines the process within <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>; as well as the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders with respect to PIAs.  Project managers have followed the framework and the draft policy when conducting their PIAs.</p>
				<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate provides advice and guidance to <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> managers throughout the PIA process, including the review of draft/final PIA versions and provision of timely feedback, in addition to liaising with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.</p>
				<p>PIAs are required when a program or service is contracted out to the private sector. Currently, when the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Legal Services review contractual terms and conditions, they inform the contracting officers to contact the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate to advise on the need for a PIA.  The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate informs the contracting officers to check with their client departments and provides the name and telephone number of the client department's <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Coordinator.  Whether or not a PIA is warranted, the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate also advises if the Department may proceed with the procurement process depending on the nature of the services and advises on the requirement to include appropriate security and privacy clauses in the documents.</p>
				<p>A partnership has been established with the Information Technology Security Directorate (ITSD) and the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate for the purpose of addressing privacy and security related issues. The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate provides ITSD with bi-weekly reports regarding privacy projects that have IT security needs.</p>
				<p>As the authority to approve PIA's rests with the Deputy Minister, a status report on the progress of individual PIAs is provided to the Deputy Minister's Office on a monthly basis.  PIA issues are discussed, as required, at the regular weekly <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> meetings.</p>
				<p>In collaboration with the Information Technology Services Branch, the <a href="/aiprp-atip/index-eng.html">Access to Information and Privacy Programs</a> Directorate launched its Internet site in January&nbsp;2005. The site is intended to facilitate the public's understanding of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> and the <em>Privacy Act</em> and associated departmental procedures, the site will soon include the publication of summaries of results of all PIA reports conducted by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>.</p>
				<p>In fiscal year 2005-2006, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate was involved in several departmental initiatives that required the development of PIAs and Preliminary PIAs (PPIAs).</p>

				<h4 id="cd">4. Statistical Report:  Interpretation and Explanation of Trends</h4>
				<p>Applicants can generally obtain access to their personal information on an informal basis by contacting the manager of the program area who controls the records.  In these instances, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate provides assistance and advice on an &quot;as required&quot; basis. Although not reflected in the statistical tables, 27&nbsp;requests were submitted by management during the fiscal year for the informal review of documents prior to their proactive disclosure to the individuals concerned.  A total of 3,864&nbsp;pages was reviewed and 3,631&nbsp;pages were recommended for release on an informal basis.  This represents a 338&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent increase in the number of requests for informal reviews from the previous year.</p>
				<p>It is the practice of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> to process requests formally where the information is sensitive and may be subject to an exemption or an exclusion pursuant to sections 18 through 28, 69 and 70 of the <em>Act</em>.</p>
				<h5 id="cda">4.1 Requests under the <em>Privacy Act</em></h5>
				<p>There were 62&nbsp;requests filed under the <em>Privacy Act</em> in 2005-2006.  The majority of cases related to employee personnel records including competitions (29&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), pension and pay (27&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), and other personal information pertaining to the applicants (34&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent).  The remaining cases related to security clearances (10&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent).</p>
				<p>In addition, four&nbsp;government institutions consulted with <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> on four&nbsp;different cases. These cases accounted for six&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate's privacy caseload.</p>
				<p>Compared to 2004-2005, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> continued to experience a decrease (two&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) in the total number of privacy requests received.</p>
				<p>One request for correction was sought by a requester pursuant to the terms of the <em>Act</em>.</p>

				<h5 id="cdb">4.2 Disposition of Completed Requests</h5>
				<p>Of the 66&nbsp;requests processed, 64 (97&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were completed during the 2005-2006 reporting period.  The remaining two&nbsp;requests (three&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were not completed as of March&nbsp;31, 2006.</p>
				<p>Taking into account only those cases where the Department was able to process the request, information was released either in whole or in part in 47&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the cases.</p>
				<p>The completed requests are categorized as follows:</p>
				<h6>4.2.1 All Disclosed</h6>
				<p>In three of the 64&nbsp;completed cases (five&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), the requesters were provided with total access to the relevant records.</p>
				<h6>4.2.2 Disclosed in Part</h6>
				<p>In 27 instances (42&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), the requesters were granted partial access. </p>
				<h6>4.2.3 Nothing Disclosed <em>(All Exempted or All Excluded)</em></h6>
				<p>There were no requests where all the information was withheld (exempted).</p>
				<h6>4.2.4 Transferred</h6>
				<p>Of the requests received, none concerned records under the control of another department.</p>
				<h6>4.2.5 Unable to Process</h6>
				<p>After initial review, the Department was unable to process requests in 31&nbsp;cases (48&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent).  In most instances, this was because the Department did not have any records that were relevant to the request.</p>
				<h6>4.2.6 Abandoned by the Applicant</h6>
				<p>Of the completed requests, three were considered to be abandoned (five&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent).  Such an action may occur at any stage of the request processing.</p>

					Top of Page</a> </div>
				<h5 id="cdc">4.3 Exemptions Invoked</h5>
				<p>As noted in Annex&nbsp;B, the majority of the exemptions invoked was under section&nbsp;26 (information about another individual) of the <em>Act</em>. </p>
				<p>Annex B is intended to show the types of exemptions invoked to deny access.  For example, if in one request five&nbsp;different exemptions were used, one exemption under each relevant section would be reported for a total of five&nbsp;exemptions.  If the same exemption is used several times for the same request, it is reported only once.</p>
				<h5 id="cdd">4.4 Exclusions Invoked</h5>
				<p>The <em>Act</em> does not apply to published material or material available for purchase by the public, library or museum material preserved solely for public record, material placed in the Library and Archives Canada, as well as records considered to be confidences of the Queen's Privy Council, pursuant to sections&nbsp;69 and 70 of the <em>Act</em> respectively.</p>
				<p>As in the case of exemptions, Annex&nbsp;B is intended to show the types of exclusions invoked to deny access.  For example, if in one request five&nbsp;different exclusions are cited, one exclusion under each relevant section would be reported for a total of five.  If the same exclusion is used several times for the same request, it is reported only once.</p>
				<p>No exclusion was cited in dealing with privacy requests.</p>
				<h5 id="cde">4.5 Completion Time</h5>
				<p>Fifty-two requests (81&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were completed within the first 30&nbsp;days and 10 (16&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were completed within 31 to 60&nbsp;days from the date of receipt by the Department.  The remaining two&nbsp;cases (three&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were completed beyond 120&nbsp;days.</p>
				<h5 id="cdf">4.6 Extensions</h5>
				<p>Time extensions were required and taken on seven&nbsp;cases.  In five&nbsp;cases, there was the need to consult with other government departments.  For the remaining two&nbsp;cases, meeting the original time limit would have unreasonably interfered with the operations of the institution.</p>
				<h5 id="cdg">4.7 Translations</h5>
				<p>There were no requests for the translation of information from one official language to another.</p>
				<h5 id="cdh">4.8 Method of Access</h5>
				<p>Copies of the records were given in response to 30&nbsp;requests (47&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent).  It should be noted that this category reflects only those requests where the information was <em>all disclosed</em> or <em>disclosed in part</em>.</p>
				<h5 id="cdi">4.9 Corrections and Notations</h5>
				<p>One request for corrections was received.</p>
				<h5 id="cdj">4.10 Costs</h5>
				<p>The amount of time devoted by <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate staff to privacy issues, including the provision of advice, is similar to the last fiscal year.</p>
				<p>Total salary costs associated with privacy issues were $256,193 and operational and maintenance costs were $152,724 for a total cost of $408,917. The associated full-time equivalent resources utilization was 4.28 for 2005-2006.</p>

				<h5 id="cea">5.1 Complaints to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada</h5>
				<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate saw an increase in the number of complaints made to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada in the 2005-2006 fiscal year.</p>
				<h6>5.1.1 New Complaints Received in 2005-2006</h6>
				<p>Of the seven complaints lodged with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner during the fiscal year, five&nbsp;complaints were against the Department about the inappropriate use and disclosure of personal information, one was about the time extension taken, and one related to the delay in responding to the request.</p>
				<h6>5.1.2 Complaints Completed in 2005-2006</h6>
				<p>Five investigations relating to the complaints received by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> in this and prior fiscal years were concluded during 2005-2006.  Of those, two&nbsp;complaints (40&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were not well founded, two (40&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were resolved - well founded, and one (20&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) was settled in the course of the investigation.</p>
				<h5 id="ceb">5.2 Requests for Judicial Review</h5>
				<p>There were no requests made to the Federal Court of Canada seeking a judicial review of any decisions taken.</p>
