				<h3 id="ptiiia">Preface</h3>
				<p>The <em>Privacy Act</em> (Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, Chapter&nbsp;P-21) was proclaimed on July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1983.  The Act was amended as a result of the royal assent of the <em>Federal Accountability Act</em> on December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2006.  Certain provisions came into force on December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2006, and others took effect on April&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2007 and September&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2007. </p>
				<p>The <em>Privacy Act</em> extends to individuals the right of access to information about themselves held by the government, subject to specific and limited exceptions.  The law also provides individuals the right to a reasonable expectation of privacy, including a basic right to exercise control over its collection, use and disclosure.</p>
				<p>Section&nbsp;72 of the <em>Privacy Act</em> requires that the head of every federal government institution prepare for submission to Parliament an annual report on the administration of the Act within the institution during each fiscal year.</p>
				<p>This Annual Report provides a summary of the management and administration of the <em>Privacy Act</em> within Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) for the fiscal year&nbsp;2007-2008.</p>

				<h4 id="pt2iiia">1. Organization of the Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) Directorate</h4>
				<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate administers the provisions of the <em>Privacy Act</em> for <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, including the two&nbsp;Special Operating Agencies, and the Office of the Procurement Ombudsman.</p>
				<h5 id="pt2iiib">1.1 Delegation Instruments</h5>
				<p>Under section&nbsp;3 of the <em>Privacy Act</em>, the Minister of the Department is designated as the head of the government institution for the purposes of the administration of the Act.</p>

				<p>The Director of the Cheque Redemption Control Directorate in Matane, Quebec shares administrative powers under paragraph&nbsp;8(2)(e) of the Act in regard to releasing original cheques to law enforcement bodies.  This provides administrative flexibility in processing requests for cheques.</p>
				<h5 id="pt2iiic">1.2 Responsibilities of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate</h5>
				<p>The Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, reports to the Director General of Executive Secretariat who, in turn, reports to the Assistant Deputy Minister of Corporate Services, Policy, and Communications Branch.</p>
				<p>The responsibilities of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate include the following:</p>
				<ul class="double-space">

					<li>developing, producing and promulgating departmental Privacy policies, procedures, standards and guidelines;</li>

							<li>new data matching programs by providing a copy of the Departmental assessment of the program, at least 60&nbsp;days before it is implemented;</li>
							<li>use or disclosure of personal information in a manner consistent with the purpose(s) for which the information was obtained or compiled, for which the consistent use is not identified in <em>Info Source</em>;</li>
							<li>development of legislation or regulations with privacy implications, prior to submission of the appropriate documentation for approval by the Governor-in-Council, or where applicable, prior to the approval of Ministerial regulations;</li>
							<li>disclosure in the public interest under paragraph&nbsp;8(2)(m) of the <em>Privacy Act</em>, either prior to the disclosure, or if this is not practicable, at the time of disclosure;</li>

					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The administration of the legislation by the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate is also facilitated at the branch, sector, and regional office levels.  Each organizational branch has an <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Liaison Officer (normally reporting to an Assistant Deputy Minister, a Director General, or a Regional Director General) who coordinates the collection of information and provides guidance to branch managers on the operation of the Act, departmental directives and procedures.</p>

				<h5 id="pt2iiid">1.3 Policies and Procedures</h5>
				<h6>1.3.1 Departmental Policies</h6>
				<p>Departmental Policy&nbsp;002 links to the Privacy delegation of authority and sets out the definitions, and the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders within <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>.  An annex to the policy has been developed to outline the administrative attribution of powers and the departmental guidelines and procedures with respect to the disclosure of personal information pursuant to subsection&nbsp;8(2) of the <em>Privacy Act</em>.  Paragraphs&nbsp;(8)(2)(j) and (m) of the Act continue to be delegated by the Minister pursuant to section&nbsp;73 of the Act.  The policy will be updated during 2008-2009 to reflect changes made as a result of the <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym> <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Policy Suite Renewal.</p>
				<p>Departmental Policy&nbsp;014 sets out the definitions and the roles and responsibilities of employees with respect to the protection of personal and private information in the workplace.</p>

				<h4 id="pt2iiie">2. Summary of Activities and Highlights</h4>
				<p>The amount of time devoted by <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate staff to privacy issues, including the provision of advice, was similar to the last fiscal year.</p>
				<h5 id="pt2iiif">2.1 Committees</h5>
				<p>As a member of the interdepartmental <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Working Group, which is chaired by <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym>, the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate has participated in the development of the revised Policy on Privacy Protection and the Directive on the Social Insurance Number (SIN) during the 2007-2008 fiscal year.  The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Policy Suite Renewal Initiative will be ongoing for the next couple of years.</p>
				<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate is represented on a departmental committee, the Computer Forensics Working Group, chaired by the Information Technology Security Directorate, where advice is required for the development of a process/protocol for ensuring that the <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> evidence gathered during an investigation is preserved in a way that it can be admitted in a court of law.</p>
				<h5 id="pt2iiig">2.2 Information Sessions</h5>
				<p>During the last fiscal year, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate has not given any presentation specific to privacy.  However, a privacy overview is typically incorporated into the general <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> information sessions.  These are included in the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Annual Report on the <em>Access to Information Act</em>.</p>
				<p>One Info Source group training session and 14&nbsp;one-on-one briefings were also provided to 42&nbsp;departmental Info Source Coordinators, managers and employees to provide advice and guidance with respect to <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym> requirements for the personal information banks.</p>

				<h6>2.3.3 Departmental Forms</h6>
				<p>Departmental Policy&nbsp;061 (Forms Management) requires that all new and revised forms that collect personal information be reviewed by the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate to ensure compliance with privacy legislative and policy requirements.  During the 2007-2008 fiscal year, 20&nbsp;requests were submitted for a compliance review and the development of the required privacy notice.</p>
				<h6>2.3.4 Disclosure Under Paragraph&nbsp;8(2)(e) of the Act</h6>
				<p>The Department processed 14&nbsp;requests for the disclosure of personal information to investigative bodies during 2007-2008. </p>

				<h6>2.3.6 Data Matching and Sharing Activities</h6>
				<p>The following data matching and sharing activities were initiated in 2007-2008.</p>
				<p><strong>Use and Storage of the Social Insurance Number (SIN) for Pension Purposes</strong></p>
				<p>During fiscal year&nbsp;2007-2008, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> has been working closely with <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym> on a proposal to authorize the use of the <acronym title="Social Insurance Number">SIN</acronym> for pension plan administration purposes. The use of the <acronym title="Social Insurance Number">SIN</acronym> is required to administer the legislated requirements of the Public Service Pension Plan, the Canadian Forces Pension Plan and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Pension Plan.  Individuals can only contribute to a maximum of 35&nbsp;years among the three&nbsp;pension plans, and to one plan at a time for any period of service.  A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, National Defence and the <acronym title="Royal Canadian Mounted Police">RCMP</acronym> has been prepared and provided to <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym> for their review.</p>
				<p><strong>Industrial Security <acronym title="Memorandums of Understanding">MOUs</acronym> with Foreign Nations</strong></p>
				<p>The Canadian and International Industrial Security Directorate is responsible for the negotiation of Industrial Security <acronym title="Memorandums of Understanding">MOUs</acronym> with foreign countries. Two&nbsp;Annexes (Protected&nbsp;A and Protected&nbsp;B Sharing of Information) were drafted for various stakeholders to review and identify privacy concerns, and provide any relevant recommendations.  This initiative will be resumed in 2008-2009.</p>

				<h4 id="pt2iiii">3. Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA)</h4>
				<p>The Treasury Board of Canada approved the <em>Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Policy</em>, with an effective date of May&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2002. The goal of the policy is to allow government institutions to identify whether a program or a service delivery initiative, involving the collection, use or disclosure of personal information as defined in the <em>Privacy Act</em>, complies with the privacy principles and to help officials avoid or mitigate any identifiable risks to privacy.</p>
				<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate has developed a departmental <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> framework and a draft departmental <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> policy that clearly outline the review and approval process within <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, as well as the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders. Project managers have followed the framework and the draft policy when conducting their <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessments">PIAs</acronym>.</p>
				<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate provides advice and guidance to <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> managers throughout the <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> process, including the review of draft/final <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> reports and liaison with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.</p>
				<p><acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessments">PIAs</acronym> are required when a program or service is contracted out to the private sector. Currently, when the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Legal Services unit reviews contractual terms and conditions, they inform the contracting officers to contact the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate to advise on the need for a <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym>.  The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate informs the contracting officers to check with their client departments and provides the name and telephone number of the client department's <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Coordinator.  The <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate also advises on the requirement to include appropriate security and privacy clauses in the procurement documentation.</p>
				<p>In collaboration with the Information Technology Services Branch, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate launched its <a href="/aiprp-atip/index-eng.html">Internet site</a> in January&nbsp;2005.  The site is intended to facilitate the public's understanding of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>, the <em>Privacy Act</em> and associated departmental procedures.  Summaries of the results of <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> reports conducted by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> are published on this web site.</p>
				<p>In fiscal year&nbsp;2007-2008, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate was involved in several departmental initiatives that required the development of <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessments">PIAs</acronym> and Preliminary <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessments">PIAs</acronym> (PPIAs). </p>

				<h6>4.1.1 Interdepartmental Consultations</h6>
				<p>In addition to the privacy requests received by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, 10&nbsp;government institutions consulted with <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> about the disclosure of information on 13&nbsp;different cases.  These consultation requests are not reflected in the statistical tables at Annex&nbsp;C, but they account for 23&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate's privacy caseload.</p>
				<h6>4.1.2 Informal Review of Records</h6>
				<p>Applicants may obtain access to their personal information on an informal basis by contacting the manager of the program area who controls the records.  In these instances, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate provides assistance and advice on an &quot;as required&quot; basis. </p>
				<p>Although not reflected in the statistical tables at Annex&nbsp;C, seven&nbsp;requests were submitted by management during the fiscal year for the informal review of documents prior to their proactive disclosure to the individuals concerned.  A total of 715&nbsp;pages were reviewed and recommended for release on an informal basis.</p>
				<div class="topPage"><a href="#tphp" title="Return to Top of Page"><img src="/clf20/images/tphp.gif" alt="" height="12" width="19" /><br />
					Top of Page</a></div>
				<h5 id="pt2iiip">4.2 Disposition of Completed Requests</h5>
				<p>Of the 73&nbsp;requests processed, 67 (92&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were completed during the 2007-2008&nbsp;reporting period.  The processing of the remaining six&nbsp;requests (eight&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) was not completed as of March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2008.</p>
				<p>Taking into account only those cases where the Department was able to process the request, information was released, either in whole or in part, in 72 per cent of the cases.</p>
				<p>The completed requests are categorized as follows:</p>
				<h6>4.2.1 All Disclosed</h6>
				<p>In 21 of the 67&nbsp;completed cases (31&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), the requesters were provided with complete access to the relevant records.</p>
				<h6>4.2.2 Disclosed in Part</h6>
				<p>In 27&nbsp;instances (40&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), the requesters were granted partial access. </p>
				<h6>4.2.3 Nothing Disclosed <em>(All Exempted or All Excluded)</em></h6>
				<p>There was no request where all of the information was withheld (exempted or excluded).</p>
				<h6>4.2.4 Unable to Process</h6>
				<p>After an initial review, the Department was unable to process 12&nbsp;requests (18&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent).  In most instances, this was because the Department did not have any records that were relevant to the request.</p>
				<h6>4.2.5 Abandoned by the Applicant</h6>
				<p>Of the completed requests, five were considered to be abandoned (eight&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent). Such an action may occur at any stage of the request processing.</p>
				<h6>4.2.6 Transferred</h6>
				<p>Although there is no provision in the legislation for transferring a request, two&nbsp;requests (three&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were transferred with the consent of the applicant and agreement of the institution of greater interest.</p>
				<h5 id="pt2iiiq">4.3 Exemptions Invoked</h5>
				<p>An individual's right of access to their personal information under the <em>Privacy Act</em> is limited by a number of exemptions specified in sections&nbsp;18 through 28 of the legislation.</p>
				<p>Annex&nbsp;C is intended to show the types of exemptions invoked to refuse access.  For example, if five&nbsp;different exemptions were used in one request, one&nbsp;exemption under each relevant section would be reported for a total of five&nbsp;exemptions.  If the same exemption was used several times for the same request, it would be reported only once.</p>
				<p>As noted in Annex&nbsp;C, the majority of the exemptions invoked was under section&nbsp;26 (information about another individual) of the Act.</p>
				<div class="topPage"><a href="#tphp" title="Return to Top of Page"><img src="/clf20/images/tphp.gif" alt="" height="12" width="19" /><br />
					Top of Page</a></div>
				<h5 id="pt2iiir">4.4 Exclusions Invoked</h5>
				<p>The Act does not apply to published material or material available for purchase by the public, library or museum material preserved solely for public record, material placed in the Library and Archives Canada, or records considered to be confidences of the Queen's Privy Council, pursuant to sections&nbsp;69 and 70 of the Act respectively.</p>
				<p>As in the case of exemptions, Annex&nbsp;C is intended to show the types of exclusions invoked to refuse access.  For example, if five&nbsp;different exclusions are cited in one request, one exclusion under each relevant section would be reported for a total of five.  If the same exclusion was used several times for the same request, it would be reported only once.</p>
				<p>No exclusion was cited in dealing with privacy requests.</p>
				<h5 id="pt2iiis">4.5 Extension of the Time Limits </h5>
				<p>Time extensions were required and taken on 19&nbsp;cases.  In three&nbsp;cases, there was the need to consult with other government departments.  For the remaining 16&nbsp;cases, meeting the original time limit would have unreasonably interfered with the operations of the institution.</p>
				<h5 id="pt2iiit">4.6 Completion Time</h5>
				<p>Forty-four&nbsp;requests (66&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were completed within the first 30&nbsp;days, 12 (18&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were completed within 31 to 60&nbsp;days, and five (seven&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were completed between 61 and 120&nbsp;days from the date of receipt by the Department.  Six&nbsp;cases (nine&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) required more than 120&nbsp;days to process. </p>
				<h5 id="pt2iiiu">4.7 Translations</h5>

				<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate saw no change in the number of complaints made to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada in the 2007-2008&nbsp;fiscal year. </p>
				<p>Of the two&nbsp;complaints lodged with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner during the fiscal year, both concerned the delay in providing a response to the requestor.</p>
				<p>Three&nbsp;investigations were concluded relating to complaints that had been received by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> in this and previous fiscal years.  Two&nbsp;complaints were resolved to the satisfaction of the requestor and the other one was settled in the course of the investigation.  Two&nbsp;complaint investigations were still being conducted at the end of the fiscal year.</p>
				<h5 id="pt2iiiaa">5.2 Requests for Judicial Review</h5>
				<p>There was one request made to the Federal Court of Canada seeking a judicial review.</p>
