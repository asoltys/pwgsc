				<h3 id="a">Preface</h3>
				<p>The <em>Access to Information Act</em> (Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, Chapter&nbsp;A-1) was proclaimed on July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1983.  The Act was amended as a result of the royal assent of the <em>Federal Accountability Act</em> on December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2006.  Certain provisions came into force on December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2006, and others took effect on April&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2007 and September&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2007.</p>
				<p>The <em>Access to Information Act</em> gives Canadian citizens and individuals present in Canada a broad right of access to information contained in government records subject to certain specific and limited exceptions.</p>
				<p>Section&nbsp;72 of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> requires that the head of every federal government institution prepare for submission to Parliament an annual report on the administration of the Act within the institution during each fiscal year.</p>
				<p>This Annual Report provides a summary of the management and administration of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> within Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) for the fiscal year&nbsp;2007-2008.</p>

				<p>For most of the 2007-2008 fiscal year, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate has operated with six&nbsp;teams in order to better manage the types of requests received within the Department. Overseeing these teams and reporting to the Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, are two&nbsp;Managers, Risk and Quality Management.

One team is committed to dealing with privacy and policy, and another team is responsible for training of new recruits to the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate in the processing of <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> requests.  Finally, one&nbsp;team is involved with all of the administrative functions and special projects conducted by the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate.</p>
				<h5 id="baa">1.1&nbsp;Delegation Instruments</h5>
				<p>Under section&nbsp;3 of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>, the Minister of the Department is designated as the head of the government institution for the purposes of the administration of the Act.</p>
				<p>The delegation instrument continued to be based on a centralized process with the Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> and the Managers, Risk and Quality Management having full delegated authority under the <em>Access to Information Act</em>.</p>
				<p>Certain administrative functions are delegated to the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Chiefs, and are limited to the following provisions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Paragraph 7(a) - Respond to request for access (nil reply only)</li>

				<h4 id="bb">2. Summary of Activities and Highlights</h4>
				<h5 id="bba">2.1 <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Improvement Plan</h5>
				<p>Each year, the Information Commissioner conducts a review of selected federal institutions that are subject to the <em>Access to Information Act</em>, and makes recommendations to help them complete at least 95&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of their <acronym title="Access to Information">ATI</acronym> requests within their legislated timelines.  Each review results in a grading of the institution's timeline performance for the period from April&nbsp;1 to November&nbsp;30 ofthe current fiscal year, and the previous fiscal year.</p>
				<p>In his June&nbsp;2007 Annual Report, the Information Commissioner rated <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s performance to a &quot;B&quot; level for the April to November&nbsp;2006 period.  However, he noted a slight decrease in the timeline performance from 92.3 to 91.3&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.  During the 2007-2008 fiscal year, the performance further decreased due to the backlog of late requests, high workload, ongoing challenges in recruiting, training and retaining qualified resources, and the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> CD Security Issue.</p>
				<p>As a result, the Department has initiated an aggressive action plan to significantly improve the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> program and achieve an &quot;A&quot; grade in FY&nbsp;2008-2009.  The plan includes the following strategies:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Reduce backlog of late requests by March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2008 - Critical Factor;</li>
					<li>Increase human resource and organizational capacity;</li>
					<li>Improve performance monitoring and productivity;</li>
					<li>Upgrade <acronym title="Information Technology">IT</acronym> infrastructure; and</li>
					<li>Improve the workplace environment.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Between mid-January and March&nbsp;2008, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate focused its efforts on eliminating its backlog of 144&nbsp;requests that were late due to various factors, including the complexity of requests and the sheer volume of documents that needed to be reviewed.  The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> team managed to process a total of 129&nbsp;late requests, in addition to 198&nbsp;on-time requests and consultations &ndash; the equivalent of six&nbsp;months of production in a matter of 2&frac12;&nbsp;months &ndash; totalling more than 155,400&nbsp;pages of records.  As a result, the Department successfully positioned itself to achieve a 95% compliance rate in FY&nbsp;2008-2009.</p>
				<h5 id="bbb">2.2 <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> CD Security Issue</h5>
				<p>In August&nbsp;2007, the Department was notified of the potential inadvertent release of information to requesters in an inappropriate CD format, which affected 138&nbsp;<acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> requests.  As soon asthis was uncovered, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate immediately changed its procedures to eliminate the problem and prevent a future recurrence.</p>
				<p>The Department promptly advised the Privacy Commissioner, as well as the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) and Public Safety Canada.  The central agencies have been consulted throughout and have been kept apprised of developments.</p>
				<p>A thorough assessment of each file was conducted to identify and mitigate possible risks where warranted.  The review concluded that there was a low likelihood that requesters saw the severed information.  It was also found, through the review, that there was no release of national security information.  However, out of caution, third&nbsp;party notification was initiated.</p>
				<p>Other government departments were advised that their information might have been inadvertently released in cases where there was a presumption of potential risk or injury by such disclosure.  Notification letters were also sent to the third&nbsp;parties in 44&nbsp;cases where the information was of a confidential, commercial or sensitive personal nature.  Copies of the records that may be at risk were provided to the third&nbsp;parties to ensure that they were fully aware of the situation.  Several follow-up conversations and meetings have also been conducted with third&nbsp;parties as warranted.</p>
				<p>The Department has acted diligently in its approach to retrieve the disks.  All requesters were contacted, except on 28&nbsp;cases where it was determined that risks to the third&nbsp;parties or the government were close to non-existent.  A total of 35&nbsp;disks out of 138 have been returned, and 18 were claimed to have been destroyed or lost.  Of the 44&nbsp;files where there was potential injury to the third&nbsp;parties, 20&nbsp;disks have been returned and 8 were claimed to have been destroyed.  For some high risk files, requesters were asked to confirm that they had not manipulated the CD in order to see the severed portions, and signed statements were obtained to that effect.  At lease two&nbsp;phone calls were made to the requesters in order to recover the remaining disks, as well as follow-up written requests on high risk of injury cases.  The Department has pursued the retrieval of the disks to the extent possible.</p>
				<p>The Office of the Information Commissioner investigated a complaint made by a third&nbsp;party, and they have concluded that this was due to a technical procedural error and, as such, was inadvertent and unintentional.  They were also satisfied that the Department properly and fully investigated the matter and that it took the necessary steps to correct the problem in order to prevent a recurrence and the use of the information that may have been potentially disclosed.</p>
				<p>The matter is considered to have been resolved and the file has been closed.</p>

				<h5 id="bbc">2.3 <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Officer Development Program</h5>
				<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Officer Development Program is intended to address the department's mid and long-term shortages of <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> professionals by recruiting new employees at the junior level, fostering their loyalty to <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, and preparing them to fill senior <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Officer positions within a three&nbsp;year horizon.  This program would also serve to reduce the costs associated with the competitive staffing process and, in the long-term, the use of consultants.</p>
				<p>The first candidate hired into the program in 2006 was promoted to the PM-02&nbsp;level in October&nbsp;2007.  A staffing process has been initiated to hire two&nbsp;new recruits in 2008-2009 from the Post Secondary Inventory.</p>
				<p>As part of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Improvement Plan, and in order to develop and retain our employees, revisions are underway to expand the program to all <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Officers at the PM-01, PM-02 and/or PM-03&nbsp;group and level that are currently employed in the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate or hired through regular advertized processes.</p>
				<h5 id="bbd">2.4 <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Consultants</h5>
				<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate continued to use <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> professional services under the terms of the competitive contract awarded to Altis/ExcelHR in 2004.  Additional consultants were also called-up under Temporary Help Services Standing Offers to help the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate in reducing its backlog of late requests before the end of the fiscal year.</p>
				<p>Two&nbsp;new one-year competitive contracts for <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> services were awarded in March&nbsp;2008 to Antian Professional Services Inc. and the Access Information Agency Inc., with the option to extend for two&nbsp;one-year periods.  These contracts will be used on an &quot;as required&quot; basis to assist with the timely processing of the requests under the Act.</p>
				<h5 id="bbe">2.5 Committees</h5>
				<p>As a member of the Interdepartmental <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Working Group, which is chaired by <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym>, the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate has participated in the development of the revised Policy on Access to Information during the 2007-2008 fiscal year.  The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Policy Suite Renewal Initiative will be ongoing for the next couple of years.</p>
				<h5 id="bbf">2.6 Information Sessions</h5>
				<p>Given the complex character of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> and the need to balance the public's right to access information with the need to protect the legitimate interests of other parties, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate provides guidance as well as information sessions, on an &quot;as required&quot; basis.</p>
				<p>During the fiscal year, six&nbsp;information sessions were given to staff in the offices of the Minister and Deputy Minister, the Independent Advisor on Public Opinion Research (POR), as well as managers and employees of the Real Property Branch, the Communications Sector, the Ministerial Regional Offices and the Ministerial Correspondence Directorate.  Approximately 65&nbsp;participants attended the information sessions.</p>
				<p>One Info Source group training session and 14&nbsp;one-on-one briefings were also provided to 42&nbsp;departmental Info Source Coordinators, managers and employees to provide advice and guidance with respect to <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym> requirements for branch descriptions and record holdings.</p>

				<h4 id="bc">3. Statistical Report - Interpretation and Explanation of Trends</h4>
				<h5 id="bca">3.1 Departmental Overview of Requests Received</h5>
				<p>All formal access requests are forwarded to the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate where they are reviewed for clarity and processed in conformity with the legislation.  Each request is then assigned to an organizational branch of the Department, which becomes responsible for locating and retrieving the records containing the information sought, and assisting in determining the costs and fees for processing the request.</p>
				<p>After a review of the relevant records, the organizational branch is responsible for formulating recommendations on the disclosure of the information.  Before a final decision is reached, they are evaluated by the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate and any necessary consultations with other organizations are undertaken.  This review process is intended to ensure consistency in the treatment of <em>Access to Information Act</em> requests.  Once a decision has been rendered, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate notifies the requester and arranges to provide access to all of the records that can be disclosed.</p>
				<p>The majority of the requests received by the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate continue to be related to the contracting services provided by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> in the domain of supply related records (i.e., contracts for goods and services, and military procurement). The Acquisitions Branch is the chief recipient of requests received.</p>
				<p>A significant volume of requests was also received pertaining to briefing notes to the Minister, and records relative to real property and the sale/leaseback of federal buildings.</p>

				<h6>3.3.2 Informal Review of Records</h6>
				<p>In order to assist departmental managers to proactively release information to the public, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate provides an informal review service.  This service is most frequently provided to the Human Resources Branch, Audit and Evaluation Branch and the Real Property Branch.  Internal audit reports comprise the majority of the requests received.</p>
				<p>Although they are not reflected in statistical tables at Annex&nbsp;B, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate received 18&nbsp;requests in 2007-2008 for the review of approximately 1500&nbsp;pages of records on an informal basis.</p>

				<h5 id="bcd">3.4 Disposition of Completed Requests</h5>
				<p><acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> is the recipient of a considerable amount of commercial, technical and financial third&nbsp;party information and, as in past years, the majority of the requests were for records containing third&nbsp;party information.  While most third&nbsp;party information is of a sensitive nature, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> has endeavoured to release as much information as possible, consistent with the spirit of the Act and the severability provisions of section&nbsp;25 of the Act.</p>
				<p>Of the 849&nbsp;requests in progress, 700 (82&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were completed during the 2007-2008 reporting period.  The remaining 149&nbsp;requests (18&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were carried forward to the next fiscal year.</p>
				<p>Of the 700&nbsp;cases where the Department completed the request, information was released either in whole or in part in 477&nbsp;requests (68&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent).</p>
				<h6>3.4.1 All Disclosed</h6>
				<p>In 87 of the 700&nbsp;completed cases (12&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), the requesters were provided with full access to the relevant records.  This figure is down by three&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent from last fiscal year.</p>
				<h6>3.4.2 Disclosed in Part</h6>
				<p>In an additional 390 of the 700&nbsp;completed cases (56&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> granted the requesters partial access. This represents a one&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent increase from last fiscal year.  In most instances, the information withheld related to third&nbsp;party information.</p>
				<h6>3.4.3 Nothing Disclosed <em>(All Exempted; All Excluded)</em></h6>
				<p>In 28 of the 700&nbsp;completed requests (four&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), there was no information released.</p>
				<h6>3.4.4 Transferred</h6>
				<p>Of the 700&nbsp;requests completed, 22 (three&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) concerned records not under the control of the Department.  After initial processing, these requests were transferred to the appropriate government institution in accordance with section&nbsp;8 of the Act.</p>
				<h6>3.4.5 Unable to Process</h6>
				<p>After initial review, the Department was unable to process 97&nbsp;requests (14&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent).  In most instances, this was because the Department did not have any records relating to the request.</p>
				<h6>3.4.6 Abandoned by Applicant</h6>
				<p>Of the completed access requests, 75 (10&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were eventually considered to be abandoned.  Such an action may occur at any stage of request processing.</p>
				<h6>3.4.7 Treated Informally</h6>
				<p>There was one&nbsp;case (less than one&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) where it was determined that the information could be released informally rather than through the formal procedures of the Act.</p>

				<h5 id="bce">3.5 Exemptions Invoked</h5>
				<p>Sections&nbsp;13 through 24 of the Act set out the exemptions intended to protect information pertaining to a particular public or private interest, and section&nbsp;26 of the Act is an administrative exception relating to the publication of information.</p>
				<p>Annex&nbsp;B is intended to show the types of exemptions invoked to refuse access.  For example, if five&nbsp;different exemptions were used in one&nbsp;request, one&nbsp;exemption under each relevant section would be reported for a total of five&nbsp;exemptions.  If the same exemption was used several times for the same request, it would be reported only once.</p>
				<p>As noted in Annex&nbsp;B, subsections&nbsp;19(1) and 24(1), and paragraphs&nbsp;20(1)(b) and (c) of the Act continue to account for the great majority of the exemptions claimed by the Department to withhold information.</p>
				<h5 id="bcf">3.6 Exclusions Invoked</h5>
				<p>The Act does not apply to published material or material available for purchase by the public, library or museum material preserved solely for public record, material placed in the Library and Archives Canada, as well as records considered to be confidences of the Queen's Privy Council, pursuant to sections&nbsp;68 and 69 of the Act respectively.</p>
				<p>As in the case of exemptions, Annex&nbsp;B is intended to show the types of exclusions invoked to refuse access.  For example, if five&nbsp;different exclusions are cited in one&nbsp;request, one&nbsp;exclusion under each relevant section would be reported for a total of five.  If the same exclusion was used several times for the same request, it would be reported only once.</p>
				<p>In the 2007-2008 fiscal period, exclusions were applied pursuant to sections&nbsp;68 and 69 of the Act on 50 (seven&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) of the total number of requests completed.</p>
				<h5 id="bcg">3.7 Extension of the Time Limits</h5>
				<p>The nature and source of information requested generally required extensive consultations and negotiations with third&nbsp;parties and other government institutions.  In 495 of the 849&nbsp;requests processed (58&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent), <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> extended the time limits pursuant to paragraphs&nbsp;9(1)(b) and (c) of the Act in order to conduct such consultations.</p>
				<p>In addition, extensions were undertaken in 51 of the requests processed (six&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;9(1)(a) of the Act.</p>

				<p>Despite the complexity of requests coupled with the steady volume of access and consultation requests received, 268 of the 700&nbsp;formal requests (38&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were completed within the initial 30-day period.</p>
				<h5 id="bci">3.9 Translations</h5>
				<p>There were no requests for the translation of information from one official language to another.</p>
				<h5 id="bcj">3.10 Method of Access</h5>
				<p>The method by which requesters prefer to obtain access to information continues to be in the form of hard paper copies of documents.  Electronic copies were also given on compact disk or sent by e-mail.</p>
				<p>Of the 477&nbsp;requests in which information was released, the requesters received copies of the information in all cases. There were no cases where access was provided by a combination of copies and in-person examination or where access was provided solely through in-person examination.  It should be noted that the data in this section reflect only those requests in which information was all <em>disclosed or disclosed in part</em>.</p>
				<h5 id="bck">3.11 Fees</h5>
				<p>The <em>Access to Information Act</em> authorizes fees for certain activities related to the processing of formal requests under the Act.  In addition to the $5&nbsp;application fee, other charges may also apply for search, preparation and reproduction of the various records, as specified in the Access to Information Regulations.</p>
				<p>No fees are imposed for reviewing records or for overhead or shipping.  Moreover, in accordance with section&nbsp;11 of the Act, no fees are charged for the first five&nbsp;hours required to search for a record or prepare any part of it for disclosure.</p>
				<p>There was a continued decrease in the amount of fees collected in relation to the search for and the reproduction of records.  This is attributed to the increase of information disclosures made in electronic format. <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> assessed fees for information provided in paper format but did not charge reproduction fees if that same information was provided on CD or diskette.  The decision to waive fees is made in accordance with the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Access to Information Fee Policy.</p>
				<p>The fees collected during the reporting period totalled $6,575.53, while the fees waived in accordance with subsection&nbsp;11(6) of the Act were $7,294.15.  Fees collected for this reporting period are estimated to represent less than one&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the total cost of the administration of the Access to Information program.</p>
				<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Credit/Debit Card System continues to be used to facilitate the payment of fees by credit cards and debit cards, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Diners/ Enroute and Interac.</p>
				<h5 id="bcl">3.12 Costs</h5>
				<p>Total salary costs associated with the program were $1,472,558 (72&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate budget) for fiscal year 2007-2008.</p>
				<p>Total operations and maintenance costs amounted to $786,228 and included the costs of consultants and maintenance of the Secret LAN and the APCM system.</p>
				<p>The associated full-time equivalent (FTE) resources utilized were estimated at 23.8 for fiscal year&nbsp;2007-2008.</p>

				<h5 id="bda">4.1 Complaints to the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada</h5>
				<p>The number of new complaints filed with the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada is the same as the previous fiscal year.</p>
				<p>Twelve (27&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) of the 44&nbsp;new complaints related to the information withheld under the Act, 11 (25&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were about the delays in responding to requests, and 10 (23&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) concerned the time extensions taken.  Of the remaining complaints, five (11&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) were about the processing of the requests, four (nine&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) related to missing records, and two (five&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent) concerned the fees assessed under the Act.</p>
				<p>Of the complaints received in this and previous fiscal years, 28 were resolved to the satisfaction of the requester, nine were not substantiated, eight were discontinued, and 70&nbsp;complaint investigations were still ongoing at the end of the fiscal year.</p>
