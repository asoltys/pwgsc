   <h3 id="pt">Preface</h3>
   <p>The <em>Access to Information Act </em>(Revised  Statutes of Canada, 1985, Chapter&nbsp;A-1) was proclaimed on July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1983.  The Act was most recently amended as a result of the royal assent of  the <em>Federal Accountability Act</em> on December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2006. Certain  provisions came into force on December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2006, and others took effect  on April&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2007, and September&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2007. </p>
   <p> The <em>Access to Information Act</em> gives Canadian citizens and individuals present in Canada a right of  access to information contained in government records subject to  certain specific and limited exceptions. </p>
   <p> Section 72 of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> requires that the head of every federal government institution prepare  for submission to Parliament an annual report on the administration of  the Act within their institution during each fiscal year. </p>
   <p> This Annual Report provides a summary of the management and administration of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> within Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) for the fiscal year 2008-2009. </p>

   <h3 id="pt1">Part I - Background </h3>
   <h4 id="pt11">1.	Public Works and Government Services Canada </h4>
   <p>The Department was originally founded in  1841 and was instrumental in the building of our nation's canals, roads  and bridges, the Houses of Parliament, post offices and federal  buildings across the country. </p>
   <p>Today, the Department has evolved into a  sophisticated operational arm of government that employs nearly 14,000  staff working in the National Capital and five regional offices in  Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton, and Vancouver. </p>
   <p>The <em>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</em>,  passed in 1996, established the Department and set out the legal  authorities for services provided. Specifically, the Act established <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> as a common service agency providing government departments,  boards and agencies with services in support of their programs,  including: </p>
   <ul>
    <li>acquisition of goods and services; </li>
    <li>office accommodation and facilities; </li>
    <li>architectural and engineering services; </li>
    <li>construction, maintenance and repair of public works and federal real property; and, </li>
    <li>provision of translation, information technology, telecommunications, industrial security, consulting and audit services.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The Act also specifies that the Minister of Public  Works and Government Services is the Receiver General for Canada and  has the authority for the administration of services related to  benefits, superannuation and pension plans as well as disbursement of  pay to federal employees.</p>
   <p><acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s goal is to run a business in a way that strengthens accountability and adds value to our clients.  In doing so, PWGSC:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>provides accommodation to parliamentarians and to more than 241,000 public servants in 1,800 locations across Canada; </li>
    <li>injects more than $14&nbsp;billion annually into the Canadian economy through government procurement; </li>
    <li>issues nearly 13.5&nbsp;million federal pay and pension payments to Canadians; </li>
    <li>helps more than 18,000 small- and medium-sized enterprises do business with the federal government; </li>
    <li>provides  translation and interpretation services annually for more than 2,000&nbsp;sessions of Parliament and 1.5&nbsp;million pages of translation for other  federal organizations; and, </li>
    <li>handles more than $1.6&nbsp;trillion in cash flow transactions as the Receiver General for Canada.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>In 2008, we improved our reporting to Parliament by  streamlining our Program Activity Architecture, which consolidates the  number of program activities from 26 to nine, and establishes our  strategic outcome as follows: High-quality, central programs and  services that ensure sound stewardship on behalf of Canadians and meet  the program needs of federal institutions. </p>
   <p>The program activities, which contribute to the Department's strategic outcome, are as follows: </p>
   <ul>
    <li>Acquisitions; </li>
    <li>Accommodation and Real Property Assets Management; </li>
    <li>Receiver General for Canada; </li>
    <li>Information Technology Infrastructure Services; </li>
    <li>Federal Pay and Pension Administration; </li>
    <li>Linguistic Management and Services; </li>
    <li>Specialized Programs and Services; </li>
    <li>Procurement Ombudsman; and,</li>
    <li>Internal Services. </li>
   </ul>

   <h3 id="pt2">Part II - Report on the <em>Access to Information Act</em></h3>
   <h4 id="pt21">1.	Organization of the Access to Information and Privacy Directorate</h4>
   <p> The Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) Directorate administers the provisions of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> for <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, including two Special Operating Agencies, Audit Services  Canada and the Translation Bureau, as well as the Office of the  Procurement Ombudsman. </p>
   <p>The Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, reports  to the Director General, Executive Secretariat, who, in turn, reports  to the Assistant Deputy Minister, Corporate Services, Policy and  Communications. For most of the 2008-2009 fiscal year, the ATIP  Directorate has operated with five  teams to manage the requests received within the Department. Overseeing  these teams, and reporting to the Director, ATIP, were two Managers,  Risk and Quality Management. Four of the teams were responsible for processing ATIP requests, consultations, complaints, and court cases received by the Department, while the other team was dedicated to privacy policy.  The administrative functions of the ATIP Directorate were supported by an administrative assistant and three clerks.</p>
   <h5 id="pt211">1.1 	Delegation Instruments</h5>
   <p>Under section 3 of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>,  the Minister of the Department is designated as the head of the  government institution for purposes of the administration of the Act.  Pursuant  to section 73, the Minister may delegate any of his powers, duties or  functions under the Act by signing an order authorizing one or more  officers or employees of the institution, who are at the appropriate  level, to exercise or perform the powers, duties or functions of the  head, specified in the order. </p>
   <p> Within <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> this delegation instrument continued to be based on a  centralized process with the Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, and the Managers, Risk and  Quality Management, having full delegated authority under the <em>Access to Information Act</em>.  Certain administrative functions are also delegated to the ATIP Chiefs to speed the processing of requests. </p>
   <p> An excerpt of the  Delegation of Authorities approved by the Minister of Public Works and  Government Services is enclosed at <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2006-2007/rapportan-anreport-eng.html#annexa">Annex A: Delegatio of nAuthorities (Excerpt)</a>.</p>
   <h5 id="pt212">1.2 	Responsibilities of the ATIP Directorate</h5>
   <p>The responsibilities of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate include the following:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>managing all activities within <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> relating to the operation of  the Act, as well as the regulations, directives and guidelines pursuant  to them; </li>
    <li>developing, producing and promulgating departmental access to information policies, procedures, standards and guidelines; </li>
    <li>developing  and delivering awareness training to PWGSC managers and staff to ensure  departmental responsiveness to the legal obligations imposed by the Act  and associated regulations; </li>
    <li>reviewing departmental policies, procedures and agreements  to ensure that they are in compliance with the provisions of the Act  and making recommendations for amendments; </li>
    <li>defending institutional decisions on the administration of  the Act during investigations conducted by the Information Commissioner  of Canada and during judicial proceedings at the Federal Court of  Canada and the Supreme Court of Canada; </li>
    <li>providing the departmental reading room where the public  may inspect manuals used by employees, in accordance with section 71  of the Act; </li>
    <li>coordinating and approving the annual update of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s chapter in the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) publication <em>Info Source</em>; </li>
    <li>reporting  annually to Parliament, in accordance with section 72 of the Act and  any instructions issued pursuant to paragraph 70(1)(<em>d</em>) of the Act; and, </li>
    <li>acting  as spokesperson for the Department in dealings with <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym>, the  Information Commissioner of Canada and other government departments and  agencies. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>The administration of the Act by the ATIP  Directorate is also facilitated at the branch, sector, and regional  office levels of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>. Each organizational branch has an ATIP Liaison  Officer who coordinates the collection of information and provides  guidance to branch managers on the application of the Act, as well as  related departmental directives and procedures.</p>

   <h5 id="pt213"> 1.3	Policies and Procedures </h5>
   <h6> 1.3.1	Departmental Policy on ATIP </h6>
   <p> For the reference of all employees, departmental policies are posted on <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s intranet. </p>
   <p> Departmental Policy 002 outlines  the access to information Delegation of Authority and sets out the  definitions as well as the roles and responsibilities of all  stakeholders within PWGSC. </p>
   <h6> 1.3.2	 ATIP Liaison Officer Handbook </h6>
   <p> The <em>ATIP Liaison Officer Handbook</em> is produced by the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate and is posted on <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s intranet as a guide to: </p>

   <h6> 1.3.3	ATIP Directorate Desk Procedures </h6>
   <p>The ATIP Directorate has developed  and regularly updates its ATIP Officer Desk Procedures manual, to  standardize the work procedures used by staff, to facilitate the  training of new hires and to complement the functionality of the  electronic ATIP tracking system. </p>
   <h4 id="pt22">2. 	Summary of Activities and Highlights </h4>
   <h5 id="pt221"> 2.1	ATIP Improvement Plan </h5>
   <p> Each year, the Information Commissioner conducts a review of selected federal institutions that are subject to the <em>Access to Information Act</em>,  and makes recommendations to help them complete their ATI requests  within the legislated timelines. Each review results in a rating of the  institution's performance for the previous year. </p>
   <p> In both 2005 and 2006, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> received a B grade rating.  However, during the 2007-2008 fiscal year PWGSC experienced a series of  challenges in its <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> program. This included an increased workload  combined with human resources, records management and information  technology concerns. Acting on performance measures and other early  warning indicators, senior management intervened to develop an  aggressive action plan to address shortcomings in the Department's ATIP  performance. Regrettably, this action plan could not be implemented in  time to prevent the Department from slipping to an F grade rating for  the 2007-2008 period. </p>
   <p> With the overarching goal of achieving an  A grade rating in 2008-2009, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s ATIP Improvement Plan includes the  following strategies: </p>
   <ul>
    <li>reduce the backlog of late requests by March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2008;</li>
    <li>increase human resource and organizational capacity; </li>
    <li>improve performance monitoring and productivity; </li>
    <li>upgrade IT infrastructure; and, </li>
    <li>improve the Directorate's accommodations. </li>
   </ul>

    Top of Page</a> </div>
   <h6>2.1.1 Action Items Completed Before The 2008-2009 Fiscal Year </h6>
   <p>By March&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2008, the  backlog of requests had been greatly reduced from a carry forward of  263&nbsp;requests at the end of 2006-2007 to 148&nbsp;request carried forward at  the end of 2007-2008, thereby positioning the Department with  substantially fewer requests at the beginning of the fiscal year. </p>
   <h6> 2.1.2 Action Items Completed During The 2008-2009 Fiscal Year</h6>
   <ul>
    <li>Seven new employees hired, as well as up to nine <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> consultants  deployed to ensure the timely processing of requests and consultations  under the Act. </li>
    <li>The ATIP Officer Development Program was revised as described in section 2.3 below. </li>
    <li>Eight ATIP staff registered in the University of Alberta ATIP Certification Program.</li>
    <li>A  zero tolerance approach to delays in processing ATI requests was  presented at the Departmental Policy Committee and adopted in July&nbsp;2008, to ensure that all departmental stakeholders understand their  role in expediting disclosures under the Act. </li>
    <li>A  Quality Circle was put in place in June&nbsp;2008 and three meetings were  held during the fiscal year. This initiative provides a forum for staff  to identify and implement process efficiencies. </li>
    <li>To address accommodation issues resulting from an  accumulation of files, temporary help staff were engaged to pack and  transfer over 250&nbsp;boxes of documents to central records in accordance  with established retention and disposal guidelines.</li>
    <li>The  office workspace was redesigned in October&nbsp;2008, including a  reconfiguration of the workstations, the purchase of new chairs for all  staff, and the construction of a dedicated filing room with mobile  shelving.</li>
   </ul>
   <h6>2.1.3 Action Items Begun During 2008-2009 And Continued To The Next  Fiscal Year </h6>
   <ul>
    <li>Advertised processes were initiated to hire a new Director as well as staff at the CR-04 and PM-02 to -04 groups and levels. </li>
    <li>An  organizational review of the ATIP Directorate was conducted by  Government Consulting Services. As a result, both a reorganization of  the office and the creation of a new Intake Unit are planned for the  next fiscal year. </li>
    <li>To increase the efficiency of processing requests, a  revised Delegation of Authority was submitted for the Minister's  approval to provide additional authorities to the ATIP Chiefs and  administrative functions to Senior ATIP Officers. Approval of this  revised Delegation of Authority is expected in the next fiscal year. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>In the next fiscal year, the ATIP Directorate  will also continue to implement the remaining activities of the action  plan. These include the review of ATIP policies and procedures,  improving the functionality of ATIP case management software, building  and maintaining capacity within the ATIP Directorate as well as  providing ATIP training and awareness sessions to departmental staff.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the  Department's timeliness and projected compliance rate will continue to  be closely monitored and reported on a weekly basis to senior  management. </p>
   <h6> 2.1.4 2008-2009 Performance Achieved </h6>
   <p>With  a successful reduction of the backlog of late requests by the end of  the 2007-2008 fiscal year, the Department surpassed its response time  objective in 2008-2009 by responding to more than 95&nbsp;percent of  requests within the legislated timeframes. </p>

   <h5 id="pt222">2.2	Management Accountability Framework (MAF) Action Plan </h5>
   <p><acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> is committed to the continuous improvement of its  management fundamentals and has used the results of the most recent <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> assessment as a benchmark. Senior management engagement has been key in  ensuring that the Department continues to improve its results. In  2008-2009, an action plan was developed to specifically address <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> Round V results relating to <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>. Key objectives were: engagement of  departmental executives on ATIP legislative and policy requirements as  well as clarifying accountabilities of departmental stakeholders in the  ATIP process; inventory of all personal information in the Department;  registration of all personal information banks (PIBs) and ensuring all  relevant information holdings are described in <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s <em>Info Source</em> chapter; piloting the revised Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat  (TBS) Privacy Impact Assess (PIA) process with the Office of the  Procurement Ombudsman; and, undertaking awareness training sessions. </p>
   <h6> 2.2.1 <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> Action Plan Activities Undertaken During The Fiscal Year </h6>
   <ul>
    <li>A  presentation was delivered to the Department Policy Committee on  November&nbsp;24,&nbsp;2008, as well as follow-up presentations to branch  management committees to inform executives of the <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> results and  engage them on the plan to address the gaps identified in the <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> assessment. </li>
    <li>Between January and March&nbsp;2009, an inventory of all  personal information held by the Department was compiled using the new <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> template developed by <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym>. The intent is to identify, develop and  register any resulting new and/or revised <acronym title="Personal Information Banks">PIBs</acronym> and to ensure that all  registered <acronym title="Personal Information Banks">PIBs</acronym> and classes of personal information are included in <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s <em>Info Source</em> chapter in accordance with the <em>Privacy Act</em>. </li>
    <li>In preparing the annual update of <em>Info Source</em>,  the ATIP Directorate obtained a copy of the most recent departmental  Program Activity Architecture in order to revise the description of  PWGSC's main functions, programs and activities in accordance with the  requirements and format instructions for <em>Info Source</em>. </li>
    <li>In  order to assist branch coordinators with the required input, the ATIP  Directorate developed a table listing all of the program activities and  sub-activities, and whether classes of records, <acronym title="Personal Information Banks">PIBs</acronym>, classes of  personal information, and manuals existed or were required for any of  the listed activities. See also section 2.6 for additional information  on training sessions and briefings delivered to departmental <em>Info Source</em> coordinators. </li>
    <li>As  a member of the <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym> ATIP Working Group, the ATIP Directorate  volunteered to work with the Office of the Procurement Ombudsman to  pilot the new PIA template and to provide feedback to <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym>. </li>
   </ul>
   <h5 id="pt223">2.3 ATIP Officer Development Program</h5>
   <p> The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Officer Development Program was developed  in 2006 to address the Department's mid- and long-term shortage of  skilled ATIP professionals by recruiting new employees at the junior  level, fostering their loyalty to <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, and preparing them to fill  senior ATIP Officer positions at the PM-04 group and level within a  three-year horizon.  The Program is also  intended to reduce the costs associated with the competitive staffing  process and, in the long-term, the use of consultants. </p>
   <p>As part of the ATIP Improvement Plan, and in order to  develop and retain our employees, the Program was revised in 2008-2009  to include all ATIP Officers at the PM-01, -02 and/or -03 group and  levels that are currently employed in the ATIP Directorate or hired  through advertised processes. This  accelerated approach to learning has been adopted by other departments  as a method of addressing skills shortages in the ATIP community. </p>

   <h5 id="pt224"> 2.4	ATIP Consultants </h5>
   <p> To address the staffing shortage facing the ATIP community, in  addition to dealing with the increase in numbers of pages requested,  the ATIP Directorate continued to use ATIP professional services under  the terms of a competitive contract awarded in March&nbsp;2008 to Antian  Professional Services Inc. and the Access Information Agency Inc. </p>
   <h5 id="pt225"> 2.5	Committees </h5>
   <p> The Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, is a member of  the Interdepartmental ATIP Working Group that is chaired by <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym>. In  this capacity, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> participated in the development of a new directive on access to information during the 2008-2009 fiscal year.  One of the managers, ATIP, is also a member of the PWGSC Information Management Specialist Working Group, that was created in response to the <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym> Information Management Policy that came into effect on July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2007.  The  objective of this policy is to achieve efficient and effective  information management to support program and service delivery; foster  informed decision making; facilitate accountability, transparency, and  collaboration; and, preserve and ensure access to information and  records for the benefit of present and future generations. </p>
   <h5 id="pt226"> 2.6 	Information Sessions </h5>
   <p> Given the complex nature of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>,  and the need to  balance the public's right to access information with  the need to protect the legitimate interests of other parties, the ATIP  Directorate provided regular guidance and information sessions. </p>
   <p> During the fiscal year, 20  information sessions were given to staff in the offices of the Minister  and Deputy Minister, the Office of the Procurement Ombudsman, as well  as managers and employees of the Human Resources Branch, the Real  Property Branch, the Communications Sector, and the Cheque Redemption  Control Directorate in Matane, Quebec. Approximately 450 participants attended these information sessions. </p>
   <p> In addition, two group training sessions and several one-on-one briefings were also provided to 30 departmental <em>Info Source</em> coordinators, managers and employees to provide advice and guidance on <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym> requirements as well as to address the gaps identified in the <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> Round V Assessment and to improve the content of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s chapter of <em>Info Source</em>. </p>

   <h4 id="pt23">3.	Statistical Report - Interpretation and Explanation of Trends </h4>
   <h5 id="pt231"> 3.1 	Departmental Overview of Requests Received </h5>
   <p> All requests pursuant to the <em>Access to Information Act</em> are processed by the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate where they are first received and reviewed for clarity.  Each request is then assigned to one or more organizational units of  the Department, that become responsible for locating and retrieving the  records containing the information sought, and identifying any costs or  fees for processing the request. </p>
   <p> The organizational units review  the relevant records and offer recommendations to the ATIP Directorate  on any sensitivities related to their disclosure. Where necessary, the  ATIP Directorate also undertakes consultations with other organizations  and third parties before a skilled ATI analyst reviews each record to  make a decision on disclosure. The ATIP Directorate then notifies the  requester and provides access to all of the records that can be disclosed. </p>
   <p> The majority of Access to  Information requests received by the Department during 2008-2009 were  related to the contracting and procurement services provided by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>.  As well, a significant volume of requests was also received for  briefing notes and question period cards to the Minister and records  regarding real property. </p>
   <h5 id="pt232"> 3.2	External Clientele </h5>
   <p>In the 2008-2009 fiscal year, the business community accounted for the highest percentage of users of the Act, generating 44&nbsp;percent of the requests received by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>. The public represented the  second largest source of requests, constituting 36&nbsp;percent of those  received, whereas the media accounted for 14&nbsp;percent, with the  remaining six percent coming from organizations and the academic  community. </p>
   <p> Table I provides an overview of  the trends related to volume of access to information requests received  by PWGSC, by source of request, over the past three years. </p>

   <p>In addition to ATI requests, the Department received 245 ATI consultations from other federal institutions in 2008-2009, amounting to approximately 25,000&nbsp;pages of records.  On average, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> responded to consultations within 25 days.

   <h6>3.3.2 	Informal Review of Records</h6>
   <p>In order to assist the Department in the proactive release of information to the public, theATIP Directorate provides an informal review service.  Although not reflected in the statistical tables at <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2008-2009/rapportan-anreport-eng.html#annexb">Annex B: Statistical Report - <em>Access to Information Act</em></a>, the ATIP Directorate received 11requests in 2008-2009 for the informal review of approximately 1,500&nbsp;pages of records.</p>
   <div class="topPage"> <a href="#tphp" title="Return to Top of Page"><img src="/clf20/images/tphp.gif" alt="" height="12" width="19" /><br />
    Top of Page</a> </div>
   <h5 id="pt234">3.4	Disposition of Completed Requests</h5>
   <p>Of the 732 requests in progress, 611&nbsp;requests (83&nbsp;percent) were completed during the 2008-2009 reporting period.  The remaining 121&nbsp;requests (17&nbsp;percent) were carried forward to the next fiscal year.  This carry forward of 121&nbsp;requests represents a reduction of 27&nbsp;requests (18&nbsp;percent) as compared to the last fiscal year.</p>
   <p> Of the 611&nbsp;cases where the Department completed the request, information was released either in whole or in part in 451&nbsp;requests (74&nbsp;percent).  The 611 completed requests represent approximately 422,000 pages of records reviewed, and over 187,356 pages released.</p>
   <h6> 3.4.1	All Disclosed </h6>
   <p> In 113 of the 611 completed  cases (18 percent), the requesters were provided with full access to  the relevant records. This figure is up by six percent from last fiscal  year. </p>
   <h6> 3.4.2	Disclosed in Part </h6>
   <p> <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> was compelled by the exemptive and exclusionary provisions of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> to provide requesters partial access in an additional 338 of the 611  completed cases (55 percent). This represents a one percent decrease  from last fiscal year. In most instances, the information withheld  related to third party information. </p>
   <h6> 3.4.3	Nothing Disclosed <em>(All Exempted; All Excluded)</em> </h6>
   <p> In 30 of the 611 completed requests (5 percent), <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> was compelled by the exemptive and exclusionary provisions of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> to release no information. This represents a one percent increase from the previous year. </p>
   <h6> 3.4.4	Transferred </h6>
   <p> Of the 611 requests completed, 11  (2 percent) concerned records not under the control of the Department.  After initial processing, these requests were transferred to the  appropriate government institution in accordance with section 8 of the  Act. </p>
   <h6> 3.4.5	Unable to Process </h6>
   <p> After initial review, the  Department was unable to process 71 requests (12&nbsp;percent). In all  instances this was because the Department did not have any records  relating to the request. </p>
   <h6> 3.4.6	Abandoned by Applicant </h6>
   <p> Of the completed access  requests, 48 (8 percent) were eventually considered to be abandoned.  Such an action may occur at any point in the processing of a request  and is most often due to a requester not paying the application fee or  fees for search and preparation. </p>
   <h6> 3.4.7	Treated Informally </h6>
   <p> None of the requests received in 2008-2009 were treated informally. </p>

   <h5 id="pt235"> 3.5	Exemptions Invoked </h5>
   <p> Sections 13 through 24 of  the Act set out the exemptions intended to protect information  pertaining to a particular public or private interest, and section 26  of the Act is an administrative exception relating to the publication  of information. </p>
   <p> <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> is the recipient of a  considerable amount of commercial, technical and financial information  from third parties and, as in past years, the majority of access to  information requests received by the Department were for records  containing third party information. While most third party information  is of a sensitive nature, PWGSC has endeavoured to release as much as  possible, to remain consistent with the spirit of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> and the severability provisions of its section 25. </p>
   <p> <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2008-2009/rapportan-anreport-eng.html#annexb">Annex B: Statistical Report - <em>Access to Information Act</em></a> is intended to show the  types of exemptions invoked to refuse access. For clarity purposes, if  five different exemptions were used in one request, one exemption under  each relevant section would be reported for a total of five exemptions.  If the same exemption was used several times for the same request, it  would be reported only once. </p>
   <p> As noted in <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2008-2009/rapportan-anreport-eng.html#annexb">Annex B: Statistical Report - <em>Access to Information Act</em></a>, personal  information (subsection 19(1)) and advice (subsection 21(1)), as well  as third party information (paragraphs 20(1)(<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>)) of the Act account for the majority of the exemptions applied by the Department. </p>
   <h5 id="pt236"> 3.6	Exclusions Invoked </h5>
   <p> Pursuant to section 68, the Act  does not apply to material that is published or available for purchase,  library or museum material preserved solely for public record, material  deposited with the Library and Archives Canada, as well as records  considered to be confidences of the Queen's Privy Council of Canada  pursuant to section 69 of the Act. </p>
   <p> <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2008-2009/rapportan-anreport-eng.html#annexb">Annex B: Statistical Report - <em>Access to Information Act</em></a> shows the types of  exclusions invoked. Again, for the sake of clarity, if five different  exclusions are cited in one request, one exclusion under each relevant  section would be reported for a total of five. If the same exclusion  was used several times for the same request, it would be reported only  once. </p>
   <p> In the 2008-2009 fiscal year, exclusions were applied pursuant to sections 68 and 69 of the Act on 49 or eight percent of the total number of requests completed. </p>
   <h5 id="pt237"> 3.7	Extension of  Time Limits </h5>
   <p> Of the 584 requests received during the fiscal year, 289 needed to be extended in accordance with section 9 of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>.  Due to the nature of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s mandate, the records requested often  contained commercial and/or government sensitive information. As a  result, many of the requests were extended pursuant to paragraphs 9(1)(<em>b</em>) and/or (<em>c</em>)  of the Act, in order to undertake the necessary consultations with  client departments and third parties prior to disclosure. While it was  estimated that, on average, a 127 day time extension was required, the  average completion time for all requests received was 92 days. </p>
   <div class="topPage"> <a href="#tphp" title="Return to Top of Page"><img src="/clf20/images/tphp.gif" alt="" height="12" width="19" /><br />
    Top of Page</a> </div>
   <h5 id="pt238"> 3.8	Completion Times </h5>
   <p> Despite the complexity of  requests, coupled with the steady volume of access and consultation  requests received, 287 of the 611 formal requests (47 percent) were  completed within the initial 30-day period. This is a nine percent  improvement over the last fiscal year. </p>
   <h5 id="pt239"> 3.9	Translations </h5>
   <p> There were no requests for the translation of information from one official language to another. </p>
   <h5 id="pt2310"> 3.10	Method of Access </h5>
   <p> Of the 451 requests in which information was released, the requesters received copies of the information in 448 cases.  There were two cases  where access was provided by a combination of copies and in-person  examination. It should be noted that the data in this section reflect  only requests for which information was <em>all disclosed</em> or <em>disclosed in part </em>and therefore not those abandoned, etc. </p>
   <p> Most requests (68 percent) were  responded to in the form of paper copies, whereas 32&nbsp;percent of cases  resulted in electronic copies. With either method of access, as well as  in-person examination, the ATIP Directorate offered the choice to the  requester. </p>
   <h5 id="pt2311"> 3.11	Fees </h5>
   <p> The <em>Access to Information Act</em> authorizes fees for certain activities related to the processing  of formal requests under the Act. In addition to the $5 application  fee, other charges may also apply for search, preparation and  reproduction of the various records, as specified in the <em>Access to Information Regulations</em>. </p>
   <p> No fees are  imposed for reviewing records or for overhead or shipping. Moreover, in  accordance with section 11 of the Act, no fees are charged for the  first five hours required to search for a record or to prepare any part  of it for disclosure. </p>
   <p> There was a continued  decrease in the amount of fees collected in relation to the search for,  and the reproduction of, records. This is attributed to the increase of  information disclosures made in electronic format. <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> assessed fees  for information provided in paper format but did not charge  reproduction fees if that same information was provided on CD or  diskette. As per the delegation instrument, any decision to waive fees  is delegated to the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Chiefs and is made in accordance with PWGSC's  Access to Information Fee Policy. </p>
   <p> The fees collected during this  reporting period totalled $6,084.60, while the fees waived  in accordance with subsection 11(6) of the Act were $4,727.70. Fees  collected for this reporting period are estimated to represent less than one percent of the Department's total cost of administering the Access to Information program. </p>
   <p>A credit/debit card system continues to be used to facilitate the payment of fees by Interac and popular credit cards. </p>

   <h5 id="pt2312"> 3.12	Costs </h5>
   <p> The total salary costs associated with the program were $1,217,770 or 40 percent of  the ATIP Directorate's budget for fiscal year 2008-2009. The associated  full-time equivalent (FTE) resources utilized were estimated at 16.18  for fiscal year 2008-2009. </p>
   <p> Total operations and maintenance  costs amounted to $1,866,219 and included the costs of consultants and  maintenance of the Secret LAN and case management system.</p>
