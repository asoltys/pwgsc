   <h3 id="pt">Preface</h3>
   <p>The <em>Access to Information Act </em>(Revised  Statutes of Canada, 1985, Chapter&nbsp;A-1) was proclaimed on July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1983.  The Act was most recently amended as a result of the royal assent of  the <em>Federal Accountability Act</em> on December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2006. Certain  provisions came into force on December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2006, and others took effect  on April&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2007, and September&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2007. </p>
   <p> Section 72 of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> requires that the head of every federal government institution prepare  for submission to Parliament an annual report on the administration of  the Act within their institution during each fiscal year. </p>
   <p> This Annual Report provides a summary of the management and administration of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> within Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) for the fiscal year 2009-2010. </p>

   <h3 id="pt1">Part I - Background </h3>
   <h4 id="pt11">1.	Public Works and Government Services Canada </h4>
   <p>The Department, founded in 1841, was instrumental in the building of our nation's canals, roads and bridges, the Houses of Parliament, post offices and federal buildings across the country.</p>
   <p>Today, the Department has evolved into a sophisticated operational arm of government that employs nearly 14,000&nbsp;staff working in the National Capital and five regional offices in Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton, and Vancouver.</p>
   <p>The <em>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</em>, passed in 1996, established the Department and set out the legal authorities for <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s services. The Act established <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> as the principal common service organization providing government departments, boards and agencies with support services for their programs.</p>
   <p>The Minister of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> is also the Receiver General for Canada and has the authority for the administration of services related to benefits, superannuation, pension plans, and the disbursement of pay to federal employees.  The Minister is  responsible for maintaining the Public Accounts of Canada.</p>
   <p><acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s goal is to run a business in a way that strengthens accountability and adds value for clients.  In doing so, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>injects more than $14&nbsp;billion annually into the Canadian economy through government procurement;</li>
    <li>issues more than 13&nbsp;million federal pay and pension payments to Canadians;</li>
    <li>provides accommodation to parliamentarians and to more than 255,000&nbsp;public servants in 1,800&nbsp;locations across Canada;</li>
    <li>provides translation and interpretation services for more than 1,800&nbsp;sessions of Parliament annually, and translates 1.7&nbsp;million pages of text on behalf of other federal organizations; and,</li>
    <li>handles more than $1.7&nbsp;trillion in cash flow transactions as the Receiver General for Canada.</li>
   </ul>
   <p><acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s Program Activity Architecture (<acronym title="Program Activity Architecture">PAA</acronym>), as approved by Treasury Board, contributes to our strategic outcome to provide  high-quality, central programs and services that ensure sound stewardship on behalf of Canadians and meet the program needs of federal institutions. The following table lists the nine program activities that comprise <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s <acronym title="Program Activity Architecture">PAA</acronym>.</p>
   <p>The program activities, which contribute to the Department's strategic outcome, are as follows: </p>
   <ul>
    <li>Acquisitions; </li>
    <li>Accommodation and Real Property Assets Management; </li>
    <li>Receiver General for Canada; </li>
    <li>Information Technology Infrastructure Services; </li>
    <li>Federal Pay and Pension Administration; </li>
    <li>Linguistic Management and Services; </li>
    <li>Specialized Programs and Services; </li>
    <li>Procurement Ombudsman; and,</li>

   <h3 id="pt2">Part II - Report on the <em>Access to Information Act</em></h3>
   <h4 id="pt21">1.	Organization of the Access to Information and Privacy Directorate</h4>
   <p>The Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) Directorate administers the provisions of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> for PWGSC, including two Special Operating Agencies, Audit Services Canada and the Translation Bureau, as well as the Office of the Procurement Ombudsman.</p>
   <p>The Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, reports to the Director General, Executive Secretariat, who, in turn, reports to the Assistant Deputy Minister, Corporate Services, Policy and Communications.  The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate was reorganized to maximize business delivery, and operates with three units to manage the requests received within the Department.  Reporting to the Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, the units are overseen by the Manager, Intake and Administration, the Manager, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Operations, and the Chief, Privacy Policy.  The first two are responsible for processing <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> requests, consultations, complaints, and court cases received by the Department, while the other is dedicated to privacy policy.  The administrative functions of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate are supported by an administrative assistant and four clerks.</p>
   <h5 id="pt211">1.1 	Delegation Instruments</h5>
   <p>Under section 3 of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>, the Minister of the Department is designated as the head of the government institution for purposes of the administration of the Act.  Pursuant to section 73, the Minister may delegate any of his powers, duties or functions under the Act by signing an order authorizing one or more officers or employees of the institution, who are at the appropriate level, to exercise or perform the powers, duties or functions of the head, specified in the order.</p>
   <p>Within <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> this delegation instrument continued to be based on a centralized process with the Director General, Executive Secretariat, who reports to the Assistant Deputy Minister of Corporate Services, Policy and Communications Branch, and the Director and Managers of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate having full delegated authority under the <em>Access to Information Act</em>.  Certain administrative functions are also delegated to the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Chiefs to speed the processing of requests.</p>
   <p>The delegation instrument was revised in 2009 to provide additional delegation to the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Chiefs to make disclosure decisions on routine requests (full disclosure, and disclosure in part with exemptions under subsection 19(1) and 24(1) of the Act).</p>
   <h5 id="pt212">1.2 	Responsibilities of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate</h5>
   <p>The responsibilities of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate include the following:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>managing all activities within <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> relating to the operation of the Act, as well as the regulations, directives and guidelines pursuant to them;</li>
    <li>developing, producing and promulgating departmental access to information policies, procedures, standards and guidelines;</li>
    <li>developing and delivering awareness training to <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> managers and staff to ensure departmental responsiveness to the legal obligations imposed by the Act and associated regulations;</li>
    <li>reviewing departmental policies, procedures and agreements to ensure that they are in compliance with the provisions of the Act and making recommendations for amendments; </li>
    <li>defending institutional decisions on the administration of the Act during investigations conducted by the Information Commissioner of Canada and during judicial proceedings at the Federal Court of Canada and the Supreme Court of Canada;</li>
    <li>providing the departmental reading room where the public may inspect manuals used by employees, in accordance with section 71 of the Act;</li>
    <li>coordinating and approving the annual update of  <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s chapter in the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (<acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym>) publication <em>Info Source</em>;</li>
    <li>reporting annually to Parliament, in accordance with section 72 of the Act and any instructions issued pursuant to paragraph 70(1)(d) of the Act; and, </li>
    <li>acting as spokesperson for the Department in dealings with <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym>, the Information Commissioner of Canada and other government departments and agencies.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The administration of the Act by the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate is also facilitated at the branch, sector, and regional office levels of PWGSC.  Each organizational branch has an <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Liaison Officer who coordinates the collection of information and provides guidance to branch managers on the application of the Act, as well as related departmental directives and procedures.</p>

   <h4 id="pt22">2. 	Summary of Activities and Highlights </h4>
   <h5 id="pt221"> 2.1	ATIP Improvement Plan </h5>
   <p>Each year, the Information Commissioner conducts a review of selected federal institutions that are subject to the <em>Access to Information Act</em>, and makes recommendations to help them complete their <acronym title="Access to Information">ATI</acronym> requests within the legislated timelines.  Each review results in a rating of the institution's performance for the previous year.</p>
   <p>With the overarching goal of achieving an A grade rating, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> initiated in December 2007 a three-year <acronym title="Access to Information Program">ATIP</acronym> Improvement Plan which includes the following strategies: </p>
   <ul>
     <li>reduce the backlog of late requests by March 31, 2008;</li>
     <li>increase human resource and organizational capacity;</li>
     <li>improve performance monitoring and productivity;</li>
     <li>upgrade IT infrastructure; and,</li>
     <li>improve the Directorate's accommodations.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>In accordance the plan, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> has reduced its backlog of late requests, increased its performance monitoring, which includes providing weekly reports to senior management on departmental <acronym title="Access to Information">ATI</acronym> compliance rates, and increased capacity through additional resources, IT infrastructure improvement and the streamlining of processes.</p>
   <p>Of the 24 institutions assessed in the 2008-2009 Report Cards of the Information Commissioner, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> ranked third receiving a rating of 4.5 stars out of 5 and a grade of B, with an above average performance on its responses to requests under the <em>Access to Information Act</em>.  As well, the Department was one of three institutions that achieved greater success than in the previous reporting period.  The Report states "<acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s dramatic improvement in compliance in 2008-2009 illustrates what is possible through a combination of planning, commitment, execution and leadership."</p>
   <p>The report contained five recommendations to the Department related to the continued implementation of the <acronym title="Access to Information">ATI</acronym> Improvement Plan, justification and notification of time extensions, and reduction in the average completion time of requests and deemed refusal rate.  <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s responses to the recommendations indicate that every effort is made to ensure that requests are completed in a transparent and timely manner.</p>
   <p>Despite a 24 percent increase of new requests, the Department maintained its compliance rate above 95 percent in 2009-2010 compared to 81 percent in 2006-2007.  It is with the management support and staff commitment to excellence that <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> was able to attain this outstanding performance for a second consecutive year.</p>
   <p>In the next fiscal year, the <acronym title="Access to Information Program">ATIP</acronym> Directorate will continue to implement the remaining activities of its action plan.  These include the review of <acronym title="Access to Information Program">ATIP</acronym> policies and procedures, upgrading the document imaging software, building and maintaining capacity within the <acronym title="Access to Information Program">ATIP</acronym> Directorate as well as providing <acronym title="Access to Information Program">ATIP</acronym> training and awareness sessions to departmental staff.  The plan will also be updated to include other actions stemming from the 2008-2009 Report Card recommendations as well as other actions identified to further improve  <acronym title="Access to Information">ATI</acronym> process and ensure legislative compliance and departmental readiness.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the Department's timeliness and projected compliance rate will continue to be closely monitored and reported on a weekly basis to senior management.</p>

   <h5 id="pt222">2.2	Management Accountability Framework (MAF) Action Plan </h5>
   <p>The MAF 12 Information Management requirements for Access to Information and Privacy (<acronym title="Access to Information Program">ATIP</acronym>) necessitate that <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> demonstrate compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements of the acts. For Access to Information, this also includes a demonstration of consistent public reporting on the administration of the Act.</p>
   <p><acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> is committed to the continuous improvement of its management fundamentals and has used the results of the <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> assessment as a benchmark.  Sustained senior management engagement is key to ensuring the Department continues to improve its results.  MOUs have been drafted between Assistant Deputy Ministers and the Deputy Minister to ensure that the activities are done to position the department to meet all the elements of <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym>.</p>
   <p>In addition to the <acronym title="Access to Information Program">ATIP</acronym> Improvement Plan, a <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> action plan was developed in 2009-2010 to specifically address the gaps identified in the <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> Round VI results relating to <acronym title="Access to Information Program">ATIP</acronym>. The <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> <acronym title="Access to Information Program">ATIP</acronym> Directorate undertook extensive work to address the shortcomings of the <em>Info Source</em> submissions.  In preparing the annual update, the <acronym title="Access to Information Program">ATIP</acronym> Directorate leveraged the current departmental Program Activity Architecture (PAA) and revised the <em>Info Source</em> descriptions of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s main functions, programs and activities in accordance with the requirements and format instructions for the 2009 <em>Info Source</em>.  </p>
   <p>In order to respond to <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym>' Management Accountability Framework 12 Round V and VI comments, the <acronym title="Access to Information Program">ATIP</acronym> Directorate designed a rigorous process to obtain all necessary information from all areas of the Department to ensure accurate and consistent definitions of the multifaceted Classes of Records (CORs).  The process developed included sending a call letter to the branch heads for the annual update of the <em>Info Source</em> advising them of the critical importance of the accuracy and comprehensive, complete and up-to-date information in order for <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> to comply with <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym> requirements. Completed as planned, this work would address <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym>' <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> Rounds V and VI gaps where <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s Chapter contained significant gaps in the description of the organisation's functions, programs, activities and related information holdings.  Branch head approval was requested for the input provided to the Access to Information and Privacy Directorate .</p>
   <p>In the work to continue to improve quality review processes, two group training sessions and several one-on-one briefings were also provided to departmental <em>Info Source</em> coordinators, managers and employees to provide advice and guidance on the <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym> requirements as well as to address the gaps identified in the <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> Assessments and to improve the content and quality of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s Chapter of <em>Info Source</em>.</p>
   <p><acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> continues to deliver against planned activities providing <em>Info Source</em> updates on time: </p>
   <p>Significant efforts continue to be made to improve the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Chapter of <em>Info Source</em>.  </p>
   <p>Given the size, diversity and complexity of the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> business operations, there were challenges to restructure the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Chapter as per <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym> requirements and to align the high volume of information with the departmental PAA, which includes descriptions of 9 program activities, 42 sub-activities, and sub-sub-sub activities in some areas, as well as the related information holdings spread across 14 branches. </p>
   <p>Updating the <em>Info Source</em> is a work in progress and <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> is committed to continuous review, refinement and improvement to ensure comprehensive and complete revisions align with <acronym title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</acronym> direction to move to a new functional approach as the target information architecture for <em>Info Source</em>.</p>
   <h5 id="pt223">2.3 ATIP Officer Development Program</h5>
   <p>The ATIP Officer Development Program was developed in 2006 and revised in 2008-2009 to address the Department's mid and long-term shortage of skilled ATIP professionals by recruiting new employees at the junior level, fostering their loyalty to PWGSC, and preparing them to fill senior ATIP Officer positions at the PM-04 group and level within a three-year horizon.  The Program is also intended to reduce the costs associated with the competitive staffing process and, in the long-term, the use of consultants.</p>
   <p>In 2009-2010, the PM-02 and PM-03 competitions launched in the previous fiscal year resulted in a pool of qualified candidates and, as of April 1, 2010, three employees have been selected and hired under the program.</p>
   <p>An external advertised process to recruit PM-01 ATIP Trainees was also undertaken during the fiscal year, and nominations will be made in summer of 2010.</p>

   <h5 id="pt224"> 2.4	ATIP Consultants </h5>
   <p>To address the staffing shortage facing the ATIP community, in addition to dealing with the increase in numbers of pages requested, the ATIP Directorate continued to use ATIP professional services under the terms of a competitive contract awarded in March 2008 to Antian Professional Services Inc. and the Access Information Agency Inc.  </p>
   <h5 id="pt225"> 2.5	Committees </h5>
   <p>The Director General, Executive Secretariat, participates on the Interdepartmental DG Committee.  The objective is to provide strategic advice to TBS on ATIP Policies and operational questions.</p>
   <p>The Director, ATIP, is a member of the Interdepartmental ATIP Working Group that is chaired by TBS.  In this capacity, PWGSC participated in the development of a new Guidelines on Access to Information during the 2009-2010 fiscal year.  </p>
   <p>One of the managers, ATIP, is also a member of the PWGSC Information Management Specialist Working Group, that was created in response to the TBS Information Management Policy that came into effect on July 1, 2007.  The objective of this policy is to achieve efficient and effective information management to support program and service delivery; foster informed decision making; facilitate accountability, transparency, and collaboration; and, preserve and ensure access to information and records for the benefit of present and future generations.</p>
   <h5 id="pt226"> 2.6 	Information Sessions </h5>
   <p>Given the complex nature of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>, and the need to balance the public's right to access information with the need to protect the legitimate interests of other parties, the ATIP Directorate provided regular guidance and information sessions.</p>
   <p>During the fiscal year, 10 information sessions were given to staff in the offices of the Minister and Deputy Minister, as well as managers and employees of the Departmental Oversight Branch, Regional Issues Managers, Intern Officers of the Acquisitions Branch, and the Strategic Review Team.  Approximately 100 participants attended these information sessions.</p>
   <p>In addition, one kick-off session, 23 group sessions and several one-on-one briefings were also provided to 103 departmental <em>Info Source</em> coordinators, managers and employees, including four conference calls with the regions, to provide advice and guidance on TBS requirements as well as to address the gaps identified in the MAF Round VI Assessment and to improve the content of PWGSC's chapter of <em>Info Source</em>.</p>

   <h4 id="pt23">3.	Statistical Report - Interpretation and Explanation of Trends </h4>
   <h5 id="pt231"> 3.1 	Departmental Overview of Requests Received </h5>
   <p>All requests pursuant to the <em>Access to Information Act</em> are processed by the ATIP Directorate where they are first received and reviewed for clarity.  Each request is then assigned to one or more organizational units of the Department, that become responsible for locating and retrieving the records containing the information sought, and identifying any costs or fees for processing the request.</p>
   <p>The organizational units review the relevant records and offer recommendations to the ATIP Directorate on any sensitivities related to their disclosure.  Where necessary, the ATIP Directorate also undertakes consultations with other organizations and third parties before a skilled ATI analyst reviews each record to make a decision on disclosure.  The ATIP Directorate then notifies the requester and provides access to all of the records that can be disclosed.</p>
   <p>The majority of Access to Information requests received by the Department during 2009-2010 were related to the contracting and procurement services provided by PWGSC. As well, a significant volume of requests was also received for briefing notes and question period cards to the Minister and records regarding real property.</p>
   <h5 id="pt232"> 3.2	External Clientele </h5>
   <p>In the 2009-2010 fiscal year, the business community accounted for the highest percentage of users of the Act, generating 42 percent of the requests received by PWGSC. The public represented the second largest source of requests, constituting 38 percent of those received, whereas the media accounted for 14 percent, with the remaining six percent coming from organizations and the academic community.</p>

   <h6>3.3.2 	Informal Review of Records</h6>
   <p>In order to assist the Department in the proactive release of information to the public, theATIP Directorate provides an informal review service.  Although not reflected in the statistical tables at <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2008-2009/rapportan-anreport-eng.html#annexb">Annex B: Statistical Report - <em>Access to Information Act</em></a>, the ATIP Directorate received 11requests in 2008-2009 for the informal review of approximately 1,500&nbsp;pages of records.</p>
   <div class="topPage"> <a href="#tphp" title="Return to Top of Page"><img src="/clf20/images/tphp.gif" alt="" height="12" width="19" /><br />
    Top of Page</a> </div>
   <h5 id="pt234">3.4	Disposition of Completed Requests</h5>
   <p>Of the 732 requests in progress, 611&nbsp;requests (83&nbsp;percent) were completed during the 2008-2009 reporting period.  The remaining 121&nbsp;requests (17&nbsp;percent) were carried forward to the next fiscal year.  This carry forward of 121&nbsp;requests represents a reduction of 27&nbsp;requests (18&nbsp;percent) as compared to the last fiscal year.</p>
   <p> Of the 611&nbsp;cases where the Department completed the request, information was released either in whole or in part in 451&nbsp;requests (74&nbsp;percent).  The 611 completed requests represent approximately 422,000 pages of records reviewed, and over 187,356 pages released.</p>
   <h6> 3.4.1	All Disclosed </h6>
   <p> In 113 of the 611 completed  cases (18 percent), the requesters were provided with full access to  the relevant records. This figure is up by six percent from last fiscal  year. </p>
   <h6> 3.4.2	Disclosed in Part </h6>
   <p> <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> was compelled by the exemptive and exclusionary provisions of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> to provide requesters partial access in an additional 338 of the 611  completed cases (55 percent). This represents a one percent decrease  from last fiscal year. In most instances, the information withheld  related to third party information. </p>
   <h6> 3.4.3	Nothing Disclosed <em>(All Exempted; All Excluded)</em> </h6>
   <p> In 30 of the 611 completed requests (5 percent), <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> was compelled by the exemptive and exclusionary provisions of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> to release no information. This represents a one percent increase from the previous year. </p>
   <h6> 3.4.4	Transferred </h6>
   <p> Of the 611 requests completed, 11  (2 percent) concerned records not under the control of the Department.  After initial processing, these requests were transferred to the  appropriate government institution in accordance with section 8 of the  Act. </p>
   <h6> 3.4.5	Unable to Process </h6>
   <p> After initial review, the  Department was unable to process 71 requests (12&nbsp;percent). In all  instances this was because the Department did not have any records  relating to the request. </p>
   <h6> 3.4.6	Abandoned by Applicant </h6>
   <p> Of the completed access  requests, 48 (8 percent) were eventually considered to be abandoned.  Such an action may occur at any point in the processing of a request  and is most often due to a requester not paying the application fee or  fees for search and preparation. </p>
   <h6> 3.4.7	Treated Informally </h6>
   <p> None of the requests received in 2008-2009 were treated informally. </p>

    Top of Page</a> </div>
   <h5 id="pt235"> 3.5	Exemptions Invoked </h5>
   <p> Sections 13 through 24 of  the Act set out the exemptions intended to protect information  pertaining to a particular public or private interest, and section 26  of the Act is an administrative exception relating to the publication  of information. </p>
   <p> <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> is the recipient of a  considerable amount of commercial, technical and financial information  from third parties and, as in past years, the majority of access to  information requests received by the Department were for records  containing third party information. While most third party information  is of a sensitive nature, PWGSC has endeavoured to release as much as  possible, to remain consistent with the spirit of the <em>Access to Information Act</em> and the severability provisions of its section 25. </p>
   <p> <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2008-2009/rapportan-anreport-eng.html#annexb">Annex B: Statistical Report - <em>Access to Information Act</em></a> is intended to show the  types of exemptions invoked to refuse access. For clarity purposes, if  five different exemptions were used in one request, one exemption under  each relevant section would be reported for a total of five exemptions.  If the same exemption was used several times for the same request, it  would be reported only once. </p>
   <p> As noted in <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2008-2009/rapportan-anreport-eng.html#annexb">Annex B: Statistical Report - <em>Access to Information Act</em></a>, personal  information (subsection 19(1)) and advice (subsection 21(1)), as well  as third party information (paragraphs 20(1)(<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>)) of the Act account for the majority of the exemptions applied by the Department. </p>
   <h5 id="pt236"> 3.6	Exclusions Invoked </h5>
   <p> Pursuant to section 68, the Act  does not apply to material that is published or available for purchase,  library or museum material preserved solely for public record, material  deposited with the Library and Archives Canada, as well as records  considered to be confidences of the Queen's Privy Council of Canada  pursuant to section 69 of the Act. </p>
   <p> <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2008-2009/rapportan-anreport-eng.html#annexb">Annex B: Statistical Report - <em>Access to Information Act</em></a> shows the types of  exclusions invoked. Again, for the sake of clarity, if five different  exclusions are cited in one request, one exclusion under each relevant  section would be reported for a total of five. If the same exclusion  was used several times for the same request, it would be reported only  once. </p>
   <p> In the 2008-2009 fiscal year, exclusions were applied pursuant to sections 68 and 69 of the Act on 49 or eight percent of the total number of requests completed. </p>
   <h5 id="pt237"> 3.7	Extension of  Time Limits </h5>
   <p> Of the 584 requests received during the fiscal year, 289 needed to be extended in accordance with section 9 of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>.  Due to the nature of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s mandate, the records requested often  contained commercial and/or government sensitive information. As a  result, many of the requests were extended pursuant to paragraphs 9(1)(<em>b</em>) and/or (<em>c</em>)  of the Act, in order to undertake the necessary consultations with  client departments and third parties prior to disclosure. While it was  estimated that, on average, a 127 day time extension was required, the  average completion time for all requests received was 92 days. </p>
   <div class="topPage"> <a href="#tphp" title="Return to Top of Page"><img src="/clf20/images/tphp.gif" alt="" height="12" width="19" /><br />
    Top of Page</a> </div>
   <h5 id="pt238"> 3.8	Completion Times </h5>
   <p> Despite the complexity of  requests, coupled with the steady volume of access and consultation  requests received, 287 of the 611 formal requests (47 percent) were  completed within the initial 30-day period. This is a nine percent  improvement over the last fiscal year. </p>
   <h5 id="pt239"> 3.9	Translations </h5>
   <p> There were no requests for the translation of information from one official language to another. </p>
   <h5 id="pt2310"> 3.10	Method of Access </h5>
   <p> Of the 451 requests in which information was released, the requesters received copies of the information in 448 cases.  There were two cases  where access was provided by a combination of copies and in-person  examination. It should be noted that the data in this section reflect  only requests for which information was <em>all disclosed</em> or <em>disclosed in part </em>and therefore not those abandoned, etc. </p>
   <p> Most requests (68 percent) were  responded to in the form of paper copies, whereas 32&nbsp;percent of cases  resulted in electronic copies. With either method of access, as well as  in-person examination, the ATIP Directorate offered the choice to the  requester. </p>
   <h5 id="pt2311"> 3.11	Fees </h5>
   <p> The <em>Access to Information Act</em> authorizes fees for certain activities related to the processing  of formal requests under the Act. In addition to the $5 application  fee, other charges may also apply for search, preparation and  reproduction of the various records, as specified in the <em>Access to Information Regulations</em>. </p>
   <p> No fees are  imposed for reviewing records or for overhead or shipping. Moreover, in  accordance with section 11 of the Act, no fees are charged for the  first five hours required to search for a record or to prepare any part  of it for disclosure. </p>
   <p> There was a continued  decrease in the amount of fees collected in relation to the search for,  and the reproduction of, records. This is attributed to the increase of  information disclosures made in electronic format. <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> assessed fees  for information provided in paper format but did not charge  reproduction fees if that same information was provided on CD or  diskette. As per the delegation instrument, any decision to waive fees  is delegated to the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Chiefs and is made in accordance with PWGSC's  Access to Information Fee Policy. </p>
   <p> The fees collected during this  reporting period totalled $6,084.60, while the fees waived  in accordance with subsection 11(6) of the Act were $4,727.70. Fees  collected for this reporting period are estimated to represent less than one percent of the Department's total cost of administering the Access to Information program. </p>
   <p>A credit/debit card system continues to be used to facilitate the payment of fees by Interac and popular credit cards. </p>

   <h5 id="pt2312"> 3.12	Costs </h5>
   <p> The total salary costs associated with the program were $1,217,770 or 40 percent of  the ATIP Directorate's budget for fiscal year 2008-2009. The associated  full-time equivalent (FTE) resources utilized were estimated at 16.18  for fiscal year 2008-2009. </p>
   <p> Total operations and maintenance  costs amounted to $1,866,219 and included the costs of consultants and  maintenance of the Secret LAN and case management system.</p>
