	<h3 id="pt">Preface</h3>
    <p>The <em>Privacy Act</em> (Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, Chapter P-21) was proclaimed on July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1983.  The Act was most recently amended as a result of the royal assent of the <em>Federal Accountability</em> Act on December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2006.  Certain provisions came into force on December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2006, and others took effect on April&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2007, and September&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2007. </p>
    <p>The <em>Privacy Act</em> extends to individuals the right of access to information about themselves held by the government, subject to specific and limited exceptions.  The Act also provides individuals the right to a reasonable expectation of privacy, including a basic right to exercise control over the collection, use and disclosure of their personal information.</p>
    <p>Section 72&nbsp;of the <em>Privacy Act</em> requires that the head of every federal government institution prepare for submission to Parliament an annual report on the administration of the Act within their institution during each fiscal year.</p>
    <p>This Annual Report provides a summary of the management and administration of the <em>Privacy Act</em> within Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) for the fiscal year 2009-2010.</p>

	<h3 id="pt1">Part I - Background </h3>
    <h4 id="pt11">1.	Public Works and Government Services Canada</h4>
    <p>The Department, founded in 1841, was instrumental in the building ofour nation's canals, roads and bridges, the Houses of Parliament, post offices and federal buildings across the country.</p>
    <p>Today, the Department has evolved into a sophisticated operational arm of government that employs nearly 14,000&nbsp;staff working in the National Capital and five regional offices in Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton, and Vancouver.</p>
    <p>The <em>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</em>, passed in 1996, established the Department and set out the legal authorities for <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym>'s services. The Act established <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> as the principle common service organization providing government departments, boards and agencies with support services for their programs.</p>
    <p>The Minister of <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> is also the Receiver General for Canada and has the authority for the administration of services related to benefits, superannuation, pension plans, and the disbursement of pay to federal employees.  The Minister is responsible for maintaining the Public Accounts of Canada.</p>
    <p><acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym>'s goal is to manage business in a way that strengthens accountability and adds value for clients.  In doing so, <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym>:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>injects more than&nbsp;$14&nbsp;billion annually into the Canadian economy through government procurement; </li>
     <li>issues nearly 13&nbsp;million federal pay and pension payments to Canadians;</li>
     <li>provides accommodation to parliamentarians and to more than 255,000&nbsp;public servants in 1,800&nbsp;locations across Canada;</li>
     <li>provides translation and interpretation services for more than 1,800&nbsp;sessions of Parliament annually, and translates 1.7&nbsp;million pages of text on behalf of other federal organizations; and,</li>
     <li>handles more than&nbsp;$1.7&nbsp;trillion in cash flow transactions as the Receiver General for Canada.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym>'s Program Activity Architecture (PAA), as approved by Treasury Board, contributes to our strategic outcome to provide  high-quality, central programs and services that ensure sound stewardship on behalf of Canadians and meet the program needs of federal institutions. The following table lists the nine program activities that comprise <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym>'s <acronym title='Program Activity Architecture'>PAA</acronym>.</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Acquisitions;</li>
     <li>Accommodation and Real Property Assets Management; </li>

	<h3 id="pt2">Part II - Report on the <em>Privacy Act</em></h3>
    <h4 id="pt21">1.	Organization of the Access to Information and Privacy Directorate</h4>
    <p>The Access to Information and Privacy Directorate (ATIP) administers the provisions of the <em>Privacy Act</em> for <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, including two Special Operating Agencies, Audit Services Canada and the Translation Bureau, as well as the Office of the Procurement Ombudsman.</p>
    <p>The Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, reports to the Director General, Executive Secretariat, who, in turn, reports tothe Assistant Deputy Minister, Corporate Services, Policy and Communications.  The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate was reorganized to maximize business delivery, and operates with three units to manage the requests received within the Department.  Reporting to the Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, the units are overseen by the Manager, Intake and Administration, the Manager, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Operations, and the Chief, Privacy Policy.  The first two are responsible for processing <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> requests, consultations, complaints, and court cases received by the Department, while the other is dedicated to privacy policy.  The administrative functions of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate are supported by an administrative assistant and four clerks.</p>
    <h5 id="pt211"> 1.1	Delegation Instruments</h5>
    <p>Under section 3&nbsp;of the <em>Privacy Act</em>, the Minister of the Department is designated as the head of the government institution for purposes of the administration of the Act.  Pursuant to section 73, the Minister may delegate any of his powers, duties or functions under the Act by signing an order authorizing one or more officers or employees of the institution, who are at the appropriate level, to exercise or perform the powers, duties or functions of the head, specified in the order.</p>
    <p>Within <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> this delegation instrument continued to be based on a centralized process with the Director General, Executive Secretariat, who reports to the Assistant Deputy Minister of Corporate Services, Policy and Communications Branch, the Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, and the Managers, Risk and Quality Management, having full delegated authority under the <em>Privacy Act</em>, with the exception of paragraph 8(2)(<em>m</em>). Certain administrative functions are also delegated to the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Chiefs to speed the processing of requests.</p>
		<p>The delegation instrument was revised in 2009&nbsp;to provide additional delegation to the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Chiefs to make disclosure decisions on routine requests (full disclosure, and disclosure in part with exemption under section 26&nbsp;of the Act).</p>
    <p>An excerpt of the Delegation of Authorities approved by the Minister of Public Works and Government Services is found at <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2009-2010/rapportan-anreport-eng.html#annexa">Annex&nbsp;A</a>.</p>
    <p>The Director, Cheque Redemption Control, in Matane, Quebec, shares administrative powers under paragraph 8(2)(<em>e</em>) of the Act in regard to releasing transacted cheques to law enforcement bodies.  This provides administrative flexibility in processing requests for cheques issued under the authority of the Receiver General for Canada.</p>

	<h4 id="pt22">2.	Summary of Activities and Highlights</h4>
    <h5 id="pt221">2.1	Management Accountability Framework (MAF) Action Plan </h5>
		<p>The <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> 12&nbsp;Information Management requirements for Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) necessitate <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> to demonstrate compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements of the acts. For Privacy, this also includes demonstration of sound management practices with respect to the handling and protection of personal information as well as consistent public reporting on the administration of the Act.</p>
    <p><acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> is committed to the continuous improvement of its management fundamentals and has used the results of the <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> assessment as a benchmark.  Sustained senior management engagement is key to ensuring the Department continues to improve its results.  <acronym title="Memorandum of Understandings">MOUs</acronym> have been drafted between ADMs and the DM to ensure that the actions are taken to position the department to meet all the elements of <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym>.</p>
    <p>In 2009-2010, an action plan was developed to specifically address <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> Round VI results relating to <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>.  In order to resolve the personal information gap, an inventory was compiled involving all branches, identifying their personal information holdings using the <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym> Personal Information Bank (PIB) checklist.  The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate has been working with the branches to identify and develop any new and/or revised <acronym title="Personal Information Banks">PIBs</acronym> resulting from approximately 170&nbsp;pieces of inventory.  As a result, several <acronym title="Personal Information Banks">PIBs</acronym> were submitted to <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym> in 2009-2010&nbsp;to ensure that all personal information under <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym>'s control is registered and appropriately described in accordance with the <em>Privacy Act</em>.</p>
    <p>Process improvements continue to be made.  The branches are now required to provide the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) summaries and related meta data at the same time that they submit the final <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> reports for approval.  As a result, the summaries of the <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessments">PIAs</acronym> completed in 2009-2010&nbsp;have been prepared in a timely manner for posting on the departmental <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Web site and the related hyperlinks are included in the annual report to Parliament, in accordance with <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym> policy and mandatory reporting requirements.</p>
		<p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate is focused on pursuing its work with the branches to address any remaining <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> gaps and ensure that the personal information holdings are described appropriately in <em>Info Source</em>.</p>
		<p>With the actions undertaken to improve compliance with the Act, the Department received a green rating in the <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> Round VI assessment results.</p>

	<h5 id="pt222">2.2	<acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Officer Development Program </h5>
    <p>The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Officer Development Program was developed in 2006&nbsp;and revised in 2008-2009&nbsp;to address the Department's mid and long-term shortage of skilled <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> professionals by recruiting new employees at the junior level, fostering their loyalty to <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym>, and preparing them to fill senior <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Officer positions at the PM-04&nbsp;group and level within a three-year horizon.  The Program is also intended to reduce the costs associated with thecompetitive staffing process and, in the long-term, the use of consultants.</p>
    <p>In 2009-2010, the PM-02&nbsp;and PM-03&nbsp;competitions launched in the previous fiscal year resulted in a pool of qualified candidates and, as of April 1, 2010, three employees have been selected and hired under the program.</p>
		<p>An external advertised process to recruit PM-01&nbsp;<acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Trainees was also undertaken during the fiscal year, and nominations will be made in summer of 2010.</p>
    <h5 id="pt223">2.3	Committees</h5>
    <p>The Director General, Executive Secretariat, participates on the Interdepartmental DG Committee.  The objective is to provide strategic advice to <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym> on <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Policies and operational questions.</p>
		<p>The Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, is a member of the Interdepartmental <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Working Group that is chaired by <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym>.  In this capacity, <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> participated in the development of new Guidelines on Privacy and a General Privacy Protocol for Non-Administrative Use during the 2009-2010&nbsp;fiscal year.</p>
    <h5 id="pt224">2.4	Information Sessions </h5>
    <p>An overview of Privacy is incorporated into the general <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> information sessions that were delivered to approximately 100&nbsp;participants during the fiscal year and are described in the <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> Annual Report on the <em>Access to Information Act</em>.</p>
    <p>In addition, one kick-off session, 23&nbsp;group sessions and several one-on-one briefings were also provided to 103&nbsp;departmental <em>Info Source</em> coordinators, managers and employees, including four conference calls with the regions, toprovide advice and guidance on <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym> requirements as well as to address the gaps identified in the <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> Round VI Assessment and to improve the content of <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym>'s chapter of <em>Info Source</em>.</p>

		<p>Between January and March 2009, an inventory of personal information held bythe Department was compiled to ensure that all personal information is appropriately described in accordance with the <em>Privacy Act</em>.  During the 2009-2010&nbsp;fiscal year, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate has reviewed this inventory to identify, develop and register any new or revised <acronym title="Personal Information Banks">PIBs</acronym> resulting from this exercise.</p>
    <p>The following five new and revised <acronym title="Personal Information Banks">PIBs</acronym><sup><a href="#footnote1" name="note1" id="note1" title="See footnote 1 for more details">1</a></sup> were registered with <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym> in 2009-2010:</p>

    <h6>2.5.6	Data Sharing Activities</h6>
    <p>The Controlled Goods Directorate (CGD) has two main objectives: to ensure that in Canada only authorized individuals access controlled goods; and, to prevent and detect unauthorized individuals from accessing controlled goods.  In order to eliminate the risk associated with the transfer of controlled goods, the <acronym title="Controlled Goods Directorate">CGD</acronym> has established procedures and agreements, in partnership with other Canadian agencies, to assist in conducting security assessment of individuals wishing to possess, examine or transfer controlled goods and more particularly foreign visitors and foreign temporary workers.</p>
    <p>The following data sharing activities were initiated by <acronym title="Controlled Goods Directorate">CGD</acronym> in 2009-2010:</p>
    <ul class="double-space">
			<li><strong>Data Sharing Between <acronym title="Controlled Goods Directorate">CGD</acronym> and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)</strong><br /><acronym title="Controlled Goods Directorate">CGD</acronym> has initiated a datasharing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the <acronym title="Canadian Security Intelligence Service">CSIS</acronym> for the provision of security assessments of foreign temporary workers and visitors who may have access to the controlled goods in Canada.  A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) has been undertaken to assess the privacy implications of the data sharing between <acronym title="Controlled Goods Directorate">CGD</acronym> and <acronym title="Canadian Security Intelligence Service">CSIS</acronym>.</li>

These reports were prepared using the analysis information gathered during the security assessment process as requested by the Canadian industry holding these controlled goods and the foreign visitors and/or foreign temporary workers. A <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> has been undertaken to assess the privacy implications related to this one-time sharing these reports with <acronym title="Canadian Security Intelligence Service">CSIS</acronym>.</li>

	<h4 id="pt23">3.	Privacy Impact Assessments</h4>
    <p> The Treasury Board of Canada approved the Privacy Impact Assessment Policy with an effective date of May&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2002. The goal of the Policy is to allow government institutions to identify whether a program or a service delivery initiative, involving the collection, use or disclosure of personal information as defined in the <em>Privacy Act</em>, complies with privacy principles.  The Policy also aims to avoid or mitigate any identifiable risks to privacy.</p>
    <p> In 2005, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate developed a departmental <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> framework and a draft departmental <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> policy that established the review and approval process within <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, as well as the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders.  Project managers follow this framework and draft policy when conducting <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessments">PIAs</acronym>.  A revised policy, that will align with <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym>'s new <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> directive, is planned for next fiscal year.</p>
    <p> The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate staff provides advice and guidance to <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> managers throughout the <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> process, including the review of <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> reports and liaison with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.</p>
    <p> Currently, when <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s Legal Services unit employees review contractual terms and conditions, they inform contracting officers to seek the advice of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate on the need for a <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym>.  The <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate informs the contracting officers to check with their client departments and provides the name and telephone number of the responsible <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Coordinator.  <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym>'s <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate also advises on the requirement to include appropriate security and privacy clauses in procurement documentation.</p>
    <p> In collaboration with the Information Technology Services Branch, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate launched its Internet site in January&nbsp;2005. The site is available at the following address: <a href="/aiprp-atip/index-eng.html">http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/aiprp-atip/index-eng.html</a>.  The site is intended to facilitate the public's understanding of the <em>Access to Information Act</em>, the <em>Privacy Act</em> and associated departmental procedures.  Summaries of the results of <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> reports conducted by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> are published on this Web site. </p>
    <p>The Department is modernizing its pension systems in order to generate savings and to improve how it delivers these services to current and retired public servants.  Using information technology products, services and programs more effectively and efficiently is also a key priority for <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>.  As a result, the Department must conduct <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessments">PIAs</acronym> for the programs and services that are substantially redesigned or transformed for electronic service delivery in a manner that affects the collection, use or disclosure of personal information.  This has lead to the initiation of six new <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessments">PIAs</acronym> in fiscal year 2009-2010&nbsp;and the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate's involvement in their development.</p>

     <li><strong>Industrial Security Program (ISP) - Release of Personal Security Screening Information</strong><br />
      A <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> was completed in relation to a proposal to substantially modify the Personal Information Bank (PIB) <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym>&nbsp;<acronym title="Particular Bank (General Public)">PPU</acronym>&nbsp;015, including a thorough description of the consistent uses, and the sharing of personal information with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, credit bureaus, and a select group of authorized persons. The privacy risks identified with the <acronym title="Personal Information Bank">PIB</acronym> and the accompanying operating procedures are being addressed, including proper communication to those affected. The <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> summary is available at: <a href="/aiprp-atip/efvp-pia/prgsecind-indsecprg-eng.html">http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/aiprp-atip/efvp-pia/prgsecind-indsecprg-eng.html</a>.

     <li><strong>Government of Canada Pension Modernization Project (GOCPMP) - Release 1.5</strong><br />
      The Government of Canada undertook a <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> to ensure that privacy was considered throughout the development and deployment of Release 1.5&nbsp;of the Pension Modernization Project (PenMod).  The privacy risks identified in the <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> of Release 1.5&nbsp;PenMod are rated "Medium" in severity.  The proposed mitigating mechanisms forthe identified privacy risks indicate a continued commitment by the Crown in ensuring the confidentiality and privacy of the personal information collected from individuals. The <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> summary and related meta data have been prepared for publication on the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> web site.
      </li>
			<li><strong>Office of the Procurement Ombudsman (OPO), Reviewing, Resolving, and Improving Procurement Related Issues</strong><br />A <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> was undertaken to assess the privacy implication of this new program activity, which reviews procurement practices across federal departments and agencies, investigates complaints from potential suppliers with respect to awards of contracts for goods and services below certain thresholds, and complaints concerning the administration of contracts; and ensures the provision of an alternative dispute resolution program for contracts.  Security and privacy measures have been taken to mitigate the privacy risks identified in the <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym>.  Sincethe <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> was completed atthe end of the fiscal year and sent to the Privacy Commissioner in April 2010, the <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> summary and related meta data are being prepared for publication on the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> web site.

			<li><strong>Online Registration and Credential Administration (ORCA)</strong><br />This shared service issues identity-based public key infrastructure (PKI) credentials to Government of Canada (GC) employees. The credential supports the secure exchange of information with the assurance of knowing that the identities of the parties involved are indeed who they say they are and also features security elements such as authentication, access control, confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation. A <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> was completed toreview the identity verification method used by the <acronym title="Online Registration and Credential Administration">ORCA</acronym> application, which is dependent on subscribers (<acronym title="Government of Canada">GC</acronym> employees) providing their personal information, known as shared secrets.  The <acronym title="Online Registration and Credential Administration">ORCA</acronym> Release 1.0&nbsp;enhancement does not pose any significant privacy risks to personal information. The <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> summary is available at: <a href="/aiprp-atip/efvp-pia/enadmjslg-olrgcrdadm-eng.html">http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/aiprp-atip/efvp-pia/enadmjslg-olrgcrdadm-eng.html</a>

			<li><strong>Receiver General Buy Button (RGBB) Upgrade</strong><br />A <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> was undertaken to review the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> service modernization that will continue to enable clients to use the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> for credit card and now also <em>Interac</em> as payment processing methods. The payment information is processed electronically using the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> service from clients' web sites (also known as storefronts) that accept electronic payments. Privacy risks have been identified with the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> upgrade service and are evaluated at 'low' in severity with a plan to mitigate these risks within an acceptable timeframe. It is important to note that the <acronym title="Receiver General Buy Button">RGBB</acronym> basic business model has not changed only the service provider and the collection of two additional pieces of personal information which will ensure accurate and secure payments are processed.

	<h4 id="pt24">4.	Statistical Report:  Interpretation and Explanation of Trends</h4>
    <h5 id="pt241">4.1	Requests under the <em>Privacy Act</em></h5>
    <p> It is the practice of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> to process requests formally where the information is sensitive and may be subject to an exemption or an exclusion pursuant to sections 18&nbsp;through 28, 69&nbsp;and 70&nbsp;of the Act.</p>
    <p>There were 78&nbsp;requests filed under the <em>Privacy Act</em> in 2009-2010.  The majority of the cases (15&nbsp;percent) were for documents related to labour relations, 14&nbsp;percent security clearances, 11&nbsp;percent staffing, 10&nbsp;percent pension and pay, and 13&nbsp;percent other employment related records.  The remaining cases (37&nbsp;percent) were for correspondence and other personal information pertaining to the requesters.</p>
    <p>Compared with the last fiscal year, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> experienced a 28&nbsp;percent increase in the total number of privacy requests received.</p>
    <p>Table II provides the related detail.</p>

    <h6>4.1.1	Interdepartmental Consultations</h6>
    <p>In addition to privacy requests, the Department received only one privacy consultation in 2009-2010, on a total of 10&nbsp;pages of records.  <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> responded to this consultation within 12&nbsp;days.  The consultation request is not reflected in the statistical tables at <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2009-2010/rapportanprrspr-anreportpract-eng.html#annexc">Annex C</a>.</p>

	<h5 id="pt242">4.2	Disposition of Completed Requests</h5>
    <p>Of the 89&nbsp;requests in progress, 71&nbsp;requests (80&nbsp;percent) were completed during the 2009-2010&nbsp;reporting period.  The remaining 18&nbsp;requests (20&nbsp;percent) were carried forward to the next fiscal year.</p>
    <p>Of the 71&nbsp;cases where the Department completed the request, information was released either in whole or in part in 42&nbsp;requests (59&nbsp;percent).  The 71&nbsp;completed requests represent approximately 12,000&nbsp;pages of records reviewed, and 10,162&nbsp;pages released.</p>
    <h6>4.2.1	All Disclosed</h6>
    <p>	In 13&nbsp;of the 71&nbsp;completed cases (18&nbsp;percent), the applicants were provided with full access to the relevant records.  This figure is a decrease by seven percentage points from last fiscal year.</p>
    <h6>4.2.2&nbsp;	Disclosed in Part</h6>
    <p><acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> was compelled by the exemptive and exclusionary provisions of the <em>Privacy Act</em> to provide applicants partial access in 29&nbsp;of the 71&nbsp;completed cases or 82&nbsp;percent.  This represents a five percentage point decrease from last fiscal year.  In most instances, the information withheld relates to information about other individuals.</p>
    <h6>4.2.3	Nothing Disclosed <em>(All Exempted or All Excluded)</em></h6>
    <p><acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> was not compelled by the exemptive and exclusionary provisions of the <em>Privacy Act</em> to release no information.</p>
    <h6>4.2.4	Unable to Process</h6>
    <p>After an initial review, the Department was unable to process 10&nbsp;requests (14percent).  Inall instances this was because the Department did not have any records relating to the request.</p>
    <h6>4.2.5	Abandoned by the Applicant</h6>
    <p>Of the completed privacy requests, 15&nbsp;(21&nbsp;percent) were eventually considered to be abandoned.  Such an action may occur at any point in the processing of a request.</p>
    <h6>4.2.6	Transferred</h6>
    <p>Four of the 71&nbsp;requests completed (6&nbsp;percent) were transferred to other government institutions in 2009-2010.</p>

	<h5 id="pt243"> 4.3	Exemptions Invoked</h5>
    <p>An individual's right of access to his/her personal information under the <em>Privacy Act</em> is limited by a number of exemptions specified in sections 18&nbsp;through 28&nbsp;of the legislation.</p>
    <p><a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2009-2010/rapportanprrspr-anreportpract-eng.html#annexc">Annex C</a> is intended to show the types of exemptions invoked to refuse access.  For clarity purposes, if five different exemptions were used in one request, one exemption under each relevant section would be reported for a total of five exemptions.  If the same exemption was used several times for the same request, it would be reported only once.</p>
    <p>As noted in <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2009-2010/rapportanprrspr-anreportpract-eng.html#annexc">Annex C</a>, information about another individual (section 26&nbsp;of the Act) accounts for the majority of the exemptions applied by the Department.</p>
    <h5 id="pt244">4.4	Exclusions Invoked</h5>
    <p>Pursuant to section 69, the Act does not apply to material that is published or available for purchase, library or museum material preserved solely for public record, material deposited with the Library and Archives Canada, as well as records considered to be confidences of the Queen's Privy Council of Canada pursuant to section 70&nbsp;of the Act.</p>
    <p>As in the case of exemptions, <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2009-2010/rapportanprrspr-anreportpract-eng.html#annexc">Annex C</a> is intended to show the types of exclusions invoked.  Again, for the sake of clarity, if five different exclusions are cited in one request, one exclusion under each relevant section would be reported for a total of five.  If the same exclusion was used several times for the same request, it would be reported only once.</p>
    <p>	Section 70&nbsp;was invoked by <acronym title='Public Works and Government Services Canada'>PWGSC</acronym> for one privacy request processed in the 2009-2010&nbsp;fiscal year.</p>
    <h5 id="pt245">4.5	Extension of the Time Limits</h5>
    <p> Of the 71&nbsp;requests completed during the fiscal year, 15&nbsp;(21&nbsp;percent) needed to be extended in accordance with section 15&nbsp;of the <em>Privacy Act</em>.  Due to the nature of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s mandate, the records requested often contained sensitive information from another government department.  As a result, in nine cases meeting theoriginal time limit would have unreasonably interfered with the operations of the Department.  For the remaining six cases, there was theneed toconsult with other government departments.</p>
    <h5 id="pt246">4.6	Completion Time</h5>
    <p>Within the first thirty days, 53&nbsp;requests (75&nbsp;percent) were completed, while 10&nbsp;(14&nbsp;percent) were completed within 31&nbsp;to 60&nbsp;days, and eight (11&nbsp;percent) were completed between 61&nbsp;and 120&nbsp;days from the date of receipt by the Department.  None of the cases required more than 120&nbsp;days to process.  On average, privacy requests were completed within 26&nbsp;days in 2009-2010&nbsp;which is 12&nbsp;days faster than the requests completed in the previous fiscal year.</p>

	<h5 id="pt247">4.7	Translations</h5>
    <p>There were three requests for the translation of information from one official language to another.</p>
    <h5 id="pt248">4.8	Method of Access</h5>
    <p>Of the 42&nbsp;requests in which information was released, the requesters received paper copies of the information in 40&nbsp;cases.  The requesters examined the records in the other two cases.</p>
    <h5 id="pt249">4.9&nbsp;	Corrections and Notations</h5>
    <p>There was one request for the correction of personal information or for a notation to be placed on a file.</p>
    <h5 id="pt2410">4.10	Costs</h5>
    <p>The total salary costs associated with the privacy program were&nbsp;$232,575, and operations and maintenance costs were&nbsp;$113,164, for a combined total of&nbsp;$345,739.  The associated full-time equivalent resources utilized were estimated at 3.24&nbsp;for the 2009-2010&nbsp;fiscal year.</p>
