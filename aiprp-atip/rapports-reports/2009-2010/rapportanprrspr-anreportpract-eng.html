	<h3 id="pt">Preface</h3>
    <p>The <em>Privacy Act</em> (Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, Chapter P-21) was proclaimed on July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1983.  The Act was most recently amended as a result of the royal assent of the <em>Federal Accountability</em> Act on December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2006.  Certain provisions came into force on December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2006, and others took effect on April&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2007, and September&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2007. </p>
    <p>The <em>Privacy Act</em> extends to individuals the right of access to information about themselves held by the government, subject to specific and limited exceptions.  The Act also provides individuals the right to a reasonable expectation of privacy, including a basic right to exercise control over the collection, use and disclosure of their personal information.</p>
    <p>Section 72 of the <em>Privacy Act</em> requires that the head of every federal government institution prepare for submission to Parliament an annual report on the administration of the Act within their institution during each fiscal year.</p>
    <p>This Annual Report provides a summary of the management and administration of the <em>Privacy Act</em> within Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) for the fiscal year 2008-2009.</p>

	<h3 id="pt1">Part I - Background </h3>
    <h4 id="pt11">1.	Public Works and Government Services Canada</h4>
    <p>The Department was originally founded in 1841 and was instrumental in the building of our nation's canals, roads and bridges, the Houses of Parliament, post offices, and federal buildings across the country.</p>
    <p>Today, the Department has evolved into a sophisticated operational arm of government that employs nearly 14,000 staff working in the National Capital and five regional offices in Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton, and Vancouver.</p>
    <p>The <em>Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</em>, passed in 1996, established the Department and set out the legal authorities for services provided. Specifically, the Act established <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> as a common service agency providing government departments, boards and agencies with services in support of their programs, including:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>acquisition of goods and services;</li>
     <li> office accommodation and facilities; </li>
     <li>architectural and engineering services;</li>
     <li> construction, maintenance and repair of public works and federal real property; and,</li>
     <li>provision of translation, information technology, telecommunications, industrial security, consulting and audit services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Act also specifies that the Minister of Public Works and Government Services is the Receiver General for Canada and has the authority for the administration of services related to benefits, superannuation and pension plans as well as disbursement of pay to federal employees.</p>
    <p><acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s goal is to run a business in a way that strengthens accountability and adds value to our clients.  In doing so, PWGSC:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>provides accommodation to parliamentarians and to more than 241,000 public servants in 1,800 locations across Canada;</li>
     <li>injects more than $14 billion annually into the Canadian economy through government procurement; </li>
     <li>issues nearly 13.5 million federal pay and pension payments to Canadians;</li>
     <li> helps more than 18,000 small- and medium-sized enterprises do business with the federal government; </li>
     <li>provides translation and interpretation services annually for more than 2,000 sessions of Parliament and 1.5 million pages of translation for other federal organizations; and,</li>
     <li>handles more than $1.6 trillion in cash flow transactions as the Receiver General for Canada.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In 2008, we improved our reporting to Parliament by streamlining our Program Activity Architecture, which consolidates the number of program activities from twenty-six to nine, and establishes the strategic outcome as follows:  High-quality, central programs and services that ensure sound stewardship on behalf of Canadians and meet the program needs of federal institutions.</p>
    <p>The <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> program activities, which contribute to the Department's strategic outcome, are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Acquisitions;</li>
     <li>Accommodation and Real Property Assets Management; </li>
     <li>Receiver General for Canada; </li>
     <li>Information Technology Infrastructure; </li>
     <li>Federal Pay and Pension Administration; </li>
     <li>Linguistic Management and Services; </li>
     <li>Specialized Programs and Services; </li>
     <li>Procurement Ombudsman; and, </li>
     <li>Internal Services.</li>
    </ul>

	<h3 id="pt2">Part II - Report on the <em>Privacy Act</em></h3>
    <h4 id="pt21">1.	Organization of the Access to Information and Privacy Directorate</h4>
    <p>The Access to Information and Privacy Directorate (ATIP) administers the provisions of the <em>Privacy Act</em> for <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, including two Special Operating Agencies, Audit Services Canada and the Translation Bureau, as well as the Office of the Procurement Ombudsman.</p>
    <p>The Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, reports to the Director General, Executive Secretariat, who, in turn, reports to the Assistant Deputy Minister, Corporate Services, Policy and Communications.  For most of the 2008-2009 fiscal year, the ATIP Directorate has operated with five teams to manage the requests received within the Department. Overseeing these teams, and reporting to the Director, ATIP, were two Managers, Risk and Quality Management.  Four of the teams were responsible for processing ATIP requests, consultations, complaints, and court cases received by the Department, while the other team was dedicated to privacy policy.  The administrative functions of the ATIP Directorate were supported by an administrative assistant and three clerks.</p>
    <h5 id="pt211"> 1.1	Delegation Instruments</h5>
    <p>Under section 3 of the <em>Privacy Act</em>, the Minister of the Department is designated as the head of the government institution for purposes of the administration of the Act.  Pursuant to section 73, the Minister may delegate any of his powers, duties or functions under the Act by signing an order authorizing one or more officers or employees of the institution, who are at the appropriate level, to exercise or perform the powers, duties or functions of the head, specified in the order.</p>
    <p>Within <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> this delegation instrument continued to be based on a centralized process with the Director General, Executive Secretariat, who reports to the Assistant Deputy Minister of Corporate Services, Policy and Communications Branch, the Director, <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>, and the Managers, Risk and Quality Management, having full delegated authority under the <em>Privacy Act</em>, with the exception of paragraph 8(2)(<em>m</em>). Certain administrative functions are also delegated to the ATIP Chiefs to speed the processing of requests.</p>
    <p>An excerpt of the Delegation of Authorities approved by the Minister of Public Works and Government Services is enclosed at <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2006-2007/rapportan-anreport-eng.html#annexa">Annex&nbsp;A: Delegation of Authority (Excerpt)</a>.</p>
    <p>The Director, Cheque Redemption Control, in Matane, Quebec, shares administrative powers under paragraph 8(2)(<em>e</em>) of the Act in regard to releasing transacted cheques to law enforcement bodies.  This provides administrative flexibility in processing requests for cheques issued under the authority of the Receiver General for Canada.</p>

    <h5 id="pt221">2.1	Management Accountability Framework Action Plan </h5>
    <p><acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> is committed to the continuous improvement of its management fundamentals and has used the results of the most recent Management Accountability Framework (MAF) assessment as a benchmark.  Senior management engagement has been key in building action plans that ensure ongoing improvement and monitor progress.</p>
    <p> In 2008-2009, an action plan was developed to specifically address <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> Round V results relating to <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym>.  Key objectives were: engagement of departmental executives on ATIP legislative and policy requirements as well as clarifying accountabilities of departmental stakeholders in the ATIP process; inventory of all personal information in the Department; registration of all <acronym title="Personal Information Banks">PIBs</acronym> and ensuring all relevant information holdings are described in <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s <em>Info Source</em> chapter; piloting the revised <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym> <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> process with the Office of the Procurement Ombudsman; and, undertaking awareness training sessions.</p>
    <h6>2.1.1 <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> Action Plan Activities Undertaken During The Fiscal Year</h6>
    <ul>
     <li>A presentation was delivered to the Department Policy Committee on November&nbsp;24,&nbsp;2008, as well as follow-up presentations to branch management committees to inform executives of the <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> results and engage them on the plan to address the gaps identified in the <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> assessment.</li>
     <li> Between January and March&nbsp;2009, an inventory of all personal information held by the Department was compiled using the new PIB template developed by <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym>.  The intent is to identify, develop and register any resulting new and/or revised <acronym title="Personal Information Banks">PIBs</acronym> and to ensure that all registered <acronym title="Personal Information Banks">PIBs</acronym> and classes of personal information are included in <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s <em>Info Source</em> chapter in accordance with the <em>Privacy Act</em>.</li>
     <li> In preparing the annual update of <em>Info Source</em>, the ATIP Directorate obtained a copy of the most recent departmental Program Activity Architecture in order to revise the description of PWGSC's main functions, programs and activities in accordance with the requirements and format instructions for <em>Info Source</em>.</li>
     <li> In order to assist branch coordinators with the required input, the ATIP Directorate developed a table listing all of the program activities and sub-activities, and whether classes of records, <acronym title="Personal Information Banks">PIBs</acronym>, classes of personal information, and manuals existed or were required for any of the listed activities.  See also section 2.4 for additional information on training sessions and briefings delivered to departmental <em>Info Source</em> coordinators.</li>
     <li> As a member of the <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym> ATIP Working Group, the ATIP Directorate volunteered to work with the Office of the Procurement Ombudsman to pilot the new <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> template and to provide feedback to <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym>.</li>

	<h5 id="pt222">2.2	<acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Officer Development Program </h5>
    <p>The ATIP Officer Development Program was developed in 2006 to address the Department's mid- and long-term shortage of skilled ATIP professionals by recruiting new employees at the junior level, fostering their loyalty to <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, and preparing them to fill senior ATIP Officer positions at the PM-04 group and level within a three-year horizon.  The Program is also intended to reduce the costs associated with the competitive staffing process and, in the long-term, the use of consultants.</p>
    <p> As part of the ATIP Improvement Plan, and in order to develop and retain our employees, the Program was revised in 2008-2009 to include all ATIP Officers at the PM-01, -02 and/or -03 group and levels that are currently employed in the ATIP Directorate or hired through regular advertised processes.  This accelerated approach to learning has been adopted by other departments as a method of addressing skills shortages in the ATIP community. </p>
    <h5 id="pt223">2.3	Committees</h5>
    <p> The Director, ATIP, is a member of the Interdepartmental ATIP Working Group that is chaired by <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym>.  In this capacity, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> participated in the development of new directives on privacy requests and correction of personal information; privacy practices; and, privacy impact assessment during the 2008-2009 fiscal year. </p>
    <h5 id="pt224">2.4	Information Sessions </h5>
    <p>During the fiscal year, four information sessions on privacy legislative and policy requirements were given to approximately 65 managers in the Information Technology Services, Human Resources, Acquisitions, Accounting, Banking and Compensation branches of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>.</p>
    <p> In addition, two group training sessions and several one-on-one briefings were also provided to 30 departmental <em>Info Source</em> coordinators, managers and employees to provide advice and guidance on <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym> requirements as well as to address the gaps identified in the <acronym title="Management Accountability Framework">MAF</acronym> Round V Assessment and to improve the content of PWGSC's chapter of <em>Info Source</em>.</p>
    <p> Furthermore, an overview of Privacy is incorporated into the general ATIP information sessions that were delivered to approximately 450 participants during the fiscal year and are described in the <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> Annual Report on the <em>Access to Information Act</em>.</p>

	<h4 id="pt23">3.	Privacy Impact Assessments</h4>
    <p> The Treasury Board of Canada approved the Privacy Impact Assessment Policy with an effective date of May&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2002. The goal of the Policy is to allow government institutions to identify whether a program or a service delivery initiative, involving the collection, use or disclosure of personal information as defined in the <em>Privacy Act</em>, complies with privacy principles.  The Policy also aims to avoid or mitigate any identifiable risks to privacy.</p>
    <p> In 2005, the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate developed a departmental <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> framework and a draft departmental <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> policy that established the review and approval process within <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, as well as the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders.  Project managers follow this framework and draft policy when conducting <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessments">PIAs</acronym>.  A revised policy, that will align with <acronym title="Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat">TBS</acronym>'s forthcoming <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> directive, is planned for next fiscal year.</p>
    <p> The ATIP Directorate staff provides advice and guidance to PWGSC managers throughout the <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> process, including the review of <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> reports and liaison with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.</p>
    <p> Currently, when <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s Legal Services unit employees review contractual terms and conditions, they inform contracting officers to seek the advice of the ATIP Directorate on the need for a <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym>.  The ATIP Directorate informs the contracting officers to check with their client departments and provides the name and telephone number of the responsible ATIP Coordinator.  PWGSC's ATIP Directorate also advises on the requirement to include appropriate security and privacy clauses in procurement documentation.</p>
    <p> In collaboration with the Information Technology Services Branch, the ATIP Directorate launched its Internet site in January&nbsp;2005. The site is available at <a href="/aiprp-atip/index-eng.html">The Access to Information and Privacy Programs</a>.  The site is intended to facilitate the public's understanding of the Access to <em>Information Act</em>, the Privacy Act and associated departmental procedures.  Summaries of the results of <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessment">PIA</acronym> reports conducted by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> are published on this Web site. </p>
    <p>The Department is modernizing its pension systems in order to generate savings and to improve how it delivers these services to current and retired public servants.  Using information technology products, services and programs more effectively and efficiently is also a key priority for <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>.  As a result, the Department must conduct <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessments">PIAs</acronym> for the programs and services that are substantially redesigned or transformed for electronic service delivery in a manner that affects the collection, use or disclosure of personal information.  This has lead to the initiation of nine new <acronym title="Privacy Impact Assessments">PIAs</acronym> in fiscal year 2008-2009 and the ATIP Directorate's involvement in their development.</p>

    <h6>4.1.1	Interdepartmental Consultations</h6>
    <p>In addition to privacy requests, the Department received six privacy consultations from six different federal institutions in 2008-2009, on a total of 39 pages of records.  On average, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> responded to consultations within 18 days.  These consultation requests are not reflected in the statistical tables at <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2008-2009/rapportanprrspr-anreportpract-eng.html#annexc">Annex C: Statistical Report - <em>Privacy Act</em></a> but do account for nine percent of the <acronym title="Access to Information and Privacy">ATIP</acronym> Directorate's privacy caseload.</p>
    <h6> 4.1.2	Informal Review of Records</h6>
    <p>Requesters may obtain access to their personal information on an informal basis by contacting the manager of the program area that controls the records.  In these instances, the ATIP Directorate provides assistance and advice on an as required basis.  Although not reflected in the statistical tables at <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2008-2009/rapportanprrspr-anreportpract-eng.html#annexc">Annex C: Statistical Report - <em>Privacy Act</em></a>, one request consisting of 364 pages was referred informally during the fiscal year prior to its proactive disclosure.</p>

	<h5 id="pt242">4.2	Disposition of Completed Requests</h5>
    <p>Of the 67 requests in progress, 56 requests (84 percent) were completed during the 2008-2009 reporting period.  The remaining 11 requests (16 percent) were carried forward to the next fiscal year.  Of this number, 8 were received in March 2009 and could not be completed before the end of the fiscal year.</p>
    <p>Of the 56 cases where the Department completed the request, information was released either in whole or in part in 32 requests (57 percent).  The 56 completed requests represent approximately 16,000 pages of records reviewed, and 7,571 pages released.</p>
    <h6>4.2.1	All Disclosed</h6>
    <p>In 13 of the 56 completed cases (23 percent), the applicants were provided with full access to the relevant records.  This figure is a decrease by eight percentage points from last fiscal year.</p>
    <h6>4.2.2 	Disclosed in Part</h6>
    <p><acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> was compelled by the exemptive and exclusionary provisions of the <em>Privacy Act</em> to provide applicants partial access in 19 of the 56 completed cases or 34 percent.  This represents a six percentage point decrease from last fiscal year.  In most instances, the information withheld relates to information about other individuals.</p>
    <h6>4.2.3	Nothing Disclosed <em>(All Exempted or All Excluded)</em></h6>
    <p>In 2 of the 56 completed requests (5 percent), <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> was compelled by the exemptive and exclusionary provisions of the <em>Privacy Act</em> to release no information.  This represents an increase from the previous fiscal year when all completed requests resulted in disclosures.</p>
    <h6>4.2.4	Unable to Process</h6>
    <p>After an initial review, the Department was unable to process 18 requests (32 percent).  In all instances this was because the Department did not have any records relating to the request.</p>
    <h6>4.2.5	Abandoned by the Applicant</h6>
    <p>Of the completed privacy requests, 4 (7 percent) were eventually considered to be abandoned.  Such an action may occur at any point in the processing of a request.</p>
    <h6>4.2.6	Transferred</h6>
    <p>None of the 56 requests completed were transferred to another government institution in 2008-2009.</p>

	<h5 id="pt243"> 4.3	Exemptions Invoked</h5>
    <p>An individual's right of access to his/her personal information under the <em>Privacy Act</em> is limited by a number of exemptions specified in sections 18 through 28 of the legislation.</p>
    <p><a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2008-2009/rapportanprrspr-anreportpract-eng.html#annexc">Annex C: Statistical Report - <em>Privacy Act</em></a> is intended to show the types of exemptions invoked to refuse access.  For clarity purposes, if five different exemptions were used in one request, one exemption under each relevant section would be reported for a total of five exemptions.  If the same exemption was used several times for the same request, it would be reported only once.</p>
    <p>As noted in <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2008-2009/rapportanprrspr-anreportpract-eng.html#annexc">Annex C: Statistical Report - <em>Privacy Act</em></a>, information about another individual (section 26 of the Act) accounts for the majority of the exemptions applied by the Department.</p>
    <h5 id="pt244">4.4	Exclusions Invoked</h5>
    <p>Pursuant to section 69, the Act does not apply to material that is published or available for purchase, library or museum material preserved solely for public record, material deposited with the Library and Archives Canada, as well as records considered to be confidences of the Queen's Privy Council of Canada pursuant to section 70 of the Act.</p>
    <p>As in the case of exemptions, <a href="/aiprp-atip/rapports-reports/2008-2009/rapportanprrspr-anreportpract-eng.html#annexc">Annex C: Statistical Report - <em>Privacy Act</em></a> is intended to show the types of exclusions invoked.  Again, for the sake of clarity, if five different exclusions are cited in one request, one exclusion under each relevant section would be reported for a total of five.  If the same exclusion was used several times for the same request, it would be reported only once.</p>
    <p>No exclusions were invoked by <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> during the processing of privacy requests in the 2008-2009 fiscal year.</p>
    <h5 id="pt245">4.5	Extension of the Time Limits</h5>
    <p> Of the 56 requests completed during the fiscal year, 13 needed to be extended in accordance with section 15 of the <em>Privacy Act</em>.  Due to the nature of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s mandate, the records requested often contained sensitive information from another government department.  As a result, in nine cases there was the need to consult with other government departments.  For the remaining four cases, meeting the original time limit would have unreasonably interfered with the operations of the Department.  On average, requests were completed within 38 days.</p>
    <h5 id="pt246">4.6	Completion Time</h5>
    <p>Within the first thirty days, 44 requests (79 percent) were completed, while 6 (11 percent) were completed within 31 to 60 days, and 2 (3 percent) were completed between 61 and 120 days from the date of receipt by the Department.  Finally, 4 cases (7 percent) required more than 120 days to process.  However, on average, privacy requests were completed within 38 days in 2008-2009 which is 12 days faster than the requests completed last year.</p>

    <h5 id="pt248">4.8	Method of Access</h5>
    <p>Of the 32 requests in which information was released, the applicants received paper copies of the information in all cases.</p>

    <p>There were no requests for the correction of personal information or for a notation to be placed on a file.</p>

    <p>The total salary costs associated with the privacy program were $221,815, and operations and maintenance costs were $207,358, for a combined total of $429,173.  The associated full-time equivalent resources utilized were estimated at 2.75 for the 2008-2009 fiscal year.</p>
